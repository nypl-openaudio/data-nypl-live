00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What a pleasure to have you here. Thank you. This is a mere Morrill of a different me show.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Called what is missing.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I think about twenty five years ago I had an idea.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I work in series as an artist usually three S. five sometimes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
seven and returns have been three times seven when I cheat and.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
knew I had at that point worked on a memorial for

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
war civil rights women's rights the women's table at Yale

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I wanted to start on one for the

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
environment because ever since I was a kid I care deeply about the environment and.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I got pulled in to do a very in-depth project on the Pacific Northwest by

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the Native American tribes along the Columbia

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
River and I put off. What would

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
be come what is missing I I mention it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and boundaries with this idea it was called the extinction project and I didn't really get started on

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it till I got a commission to the California country sciences to make an

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
artwork and as opposed to just making an artwork. I made them two.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And the second one was the beginning of what is missing your

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
interest your interest in zoology you include you know made this in your interest of interest or not are you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I would say ever since I was a kid grew up in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the sixty's

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
seventy's and I mean it was a wee wee in gauging time

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
whether it was the Vietnam War civil rights issues women's rights

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
issues and for

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
me grew up in Ohio Lake Erie catches on fire you have

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
really the formation of an establishment of the clean air the Clean Water Act

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the Endangered Species Act by nine hundred seventy

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
three and it really had an oppression on me as a child and I actually

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
went to college to study fields who already.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You know. And so I've

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
always cared about the environment. But you stopped at that point because. It's a source

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
us. Morning to you. Well I was given you know you enter

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
college went to Yale and you were given an advisor. I was

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
given this wonderful science advisor. Actually he was

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
an acoustic Jim Dr Robert Apple and. He said you know my

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the animal behavior program. You know is is neurologically

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
based and it involves a section and I didn't really know what that meant but when I

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
found out I was sort of well this might not be what I'm quite interested

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in being a bit of a nerd. I was sort of nervous because I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
was thinking I'm going

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to go into this and I remember it was. Freshman like entry

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
day and looked up at the ceiling of all the hall and I thought

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
well what about

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
architecture because it's sort of bland art and science and math

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
because I kind of like I was a bit of a polyglot and so I go running over to the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
architecture department and the directors that go away come back at the end of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
your sophomore year because we don't want anyone to come in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and specialized go out there and just follow whatever interests.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There are so I took everything from the geology of the Long Island Sound to our classes just.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And then applied and went to the Major.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But I think it's interesting

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
with this passion of users never very. It's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
very little but time always

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and yeah and I think I'll just remember as a kid my

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
parents they kind of wouldn't let us have pets it wasn't that they were

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
like against pets I think my mom just thought you know that pet was not in their own language

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
like we had a cat once for a little while I can't remember what happened to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it so I was recently I was like I don't want to know what happened

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I. We were in a house surrounded by the words

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
this concern really

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
stupid. And I would sit in the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
lawn and I would sit really still till

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
like I could get like the rabbits to get kind of close or the birds would like

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
come in they my dad always said that they kind of train east of it they would come to the window when

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
they wanted me to feed

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
them or I'd open the door and leave a trail of peanuts into the house and the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
chipmunks and squirrels would come in so I've always loved animals despite the fact that my parents were a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
little bit horrified by you know what are you doing

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
anyway yeah so I always

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
want the natural world.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Going to look at some images of the I Q two to come with them we're going to look at the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
last images just preparing you for voyage. Yes through my

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
aliens would. And let's begin

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
there through this is called the listening town. It is the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
first installation of what is missing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The idea of what is missing is what if you could make a

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
memorial that could be in as many

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
places as it was invited in it could exist as

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
temporary installations permanent

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
installations it exists as a website what is missing dot net that will exist as a virtual in

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
a physical book and to me it frees long as you share it. So this

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
was at Renzo Piano he was designing and

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
McAlpin Academy of Sciences this is were I had an Art Commission I

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
built an outdoor wire landscape of the San Francisco Bay on their western

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
terrace and Renzo was like well you can use the extreme of the Eastern

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
terrorists here the thing about his P.R. has Heaven forbid you would put an artwork in one of

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
his P.R. says

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so so I was out of doors and I was very

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
interested in using sound and video but I'm out of doors.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So in order to make a piece. That would engage visually as well

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
as with sound. I had to create an enclosure and so this.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Listening counted sort of based on the R.C.A. Victor kids sit inside the reclaimed

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Redwood wood and listen and

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the B.B.C. National Geographic and Cornell and dodgy labs

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
donated sounds. And we started doing this

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
research and we've right now what is on the scene has produced about seventy

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
five one to two minute educational videos about

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
species habitat issues and then this intro clip is what

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is played at the beginning

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and what do the human

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
because the very first thing they'll hear is an animal sound or sound of a

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
habitat like the whole rain

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
forest and we're very

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
visual so the idea

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
was twofold. If you

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
can't see it and you hear it first. Your your brain kind of clicks on

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to a different way of a relationship and you're also very curious. So I'm always trying

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
to wrest the visual and then the still not always stayed in like the one you

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
saw of the loon. And you begin to read it first before.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Again you see it so the last thing you see is the visual and then

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
the text as you go through it

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
it's never me. Another thing that I thought would be very important for

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
me to do with what is missing is to act as a frame

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
where we're quoting from all the

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
N.G.O.s all the scientific groups and what you begin to see

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is to see this group as a family

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and to see their gains and their losses this show's.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Creative Time and the M.T.V. billboard creative time got me the M.T.V. billboard

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in the month of April in two thousand and three and we again

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
created four

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
one five minute films that talked about different things that were missing. So

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
again it's not. Just the species of the habitat. They need but it's also not just

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
an individual species. It's the entire group of sea turtles that are risk all

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
the great apes are at risk all the station in the ocean and ninety percent collapse.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
is our website you can see a lot of dots and.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You can click View in time where you can see it Jill a good question extraordinary to go

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
on each one is a story of the natural world there

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
are timelines that show an in-depth like a hundred point history of

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
a city or a

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
river because what happens is you the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
people whiffed where there was great abundance the first thing that goes

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
through sewage pollution and industrial and then you see the arc of

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
recovery were laws come into place. So again that link between conservation

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in Travolta beginning to protect and then like in New York

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Harbor the seals come back the first

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
will cited. But what you might not know is

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that you know in the sixteen eighties.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Adrian Vander donk accounted for was trees that were six feet long.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I don't have a lot of those here have and of G.L. offend your right to

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
choose

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but that's good we'll go to that but basically So what do we do.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We ask you there's some note cards please take one but then you owe me a

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
memory. At a personal

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
memory if it's something you remember that your parents or your grandparents told told

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you about diminished natural abundance.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Or maybe some things come back because the phenomena

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that scientists refer to is shifting baselines injured diamond refers to

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the landscape did nature is that we accept what we

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
know we don't

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
remember that cotton rewards are than men in the eighteenth

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
ninety's we won't know how

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
abundant shelves this were so that they almost purified Chesapeake Bay

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
every day. And that someone would build is the churning of the water

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
was

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
from the shellfish queen and so basically are we doing this am I doing it to depress you

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
know I'm doing it to make your jaw drop open that.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Natured the natural world is capable of that sort of abundance and actually nature

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
is incredibly

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
resilient and if we give it a chance it comes back. So part of

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the part of it

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
is to engage you and to get you to realize what's in your own backyard. What you

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
can do

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and then the second part is what you can do as

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
individuals as well

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
as what you can do with moments more macro thinking

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and so we're working on the last two years. It's called green planet which will take

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that white at night for you and rearrange the lights

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
with economics in mind with urban planning in mind with with

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
agricultural footprints in mind so. So it's kind of a I kind of went off the deep end and I've got two

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
more years of I would say fairly nerdy research work would you enjoy

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that I do would you almost

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
like I would say fifty percent of my mind is on Messina at any

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
given time it's a volunteer project for

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
me and I just feel if I could make

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
one little bit of difference here I'm going to I'm going to

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
try and so this is what you were talking about earlier. How important the text news

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and a lot of the sources are around that isn't your boy yes

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
it's never it's never my voice but I don't think it's ever been my voice. I

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
always love you I or any of your projects. Well I think it's a

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
funny one I think I love presenting factual

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
information and then generally what I'm after

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
is your response to it. The thing that makes missing different. Is there is a

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
whole side of the website. So this is like this is where I go normally it's

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
like elfin depletion I mean we're basically able.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
List of all the animals that are in a ninety nine percent ninety seven to ninety nine

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
percent crash whether it's bison or sea turtles or elephants

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
or or whines or tigers I mean it's incredible. What's happened and you

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
might not realize this and and I

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
think we've lost my train of thought world as I go and you knew going. But this is

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
sort of of still not only do we ask for personal memories.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
We have volunteers historians.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Our researchers finding incredible accounts of

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
natural abundance. We've got the very

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
first accounting we think of Plato and prettiest and he talks

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
about the hills in Greece and how bare they are and how they were

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
once forested sometimes you know

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
we get about to be the depressing part which is the role. It's

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
depressing except for the fact that and someone said we'll do we do we have time

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
be depressed and what will depression really do I think it. Hopefully will wake

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
a sense and say hey I can do something about this. So whether it's choosing

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to. You know to consume

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
organic shade grown fair trade coffee which can support one

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
hundred fifty species versus twenty to thirty in a plantation. There are so many

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
things we can do in our consumer choices as well

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
as the kind of green print is really going to focus

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
on. The intersection between landscape

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
reform agricultural restoration prevention of

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
deforestation coastal development

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
how those all together the changes in Wendy's if we reform

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
those

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
practices would be equivalent Thomas forty nine percent of all carbon emissions. So I came

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
up with another film. You can go to the website it's called and

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
shopping actually. And it's basically we can save two birds with one tree.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So I think we have to move very quickly to reduce climate

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
change missions

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and a great way to do it is to restore and protect habitats

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
so facts like you know where one requests are three times as much carbon

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
as a tropical forest and with climate change happening so

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
rapidly. It's our best line of defense against rising sea

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
ties and how many times are we going to rebuild in the same location and we build and rebuild.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
When if we just are a little bit more logical

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and say hey we created in return coastal wetlands in certain

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.000
areas that are

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
just at really the

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
brunt of the hit in move back a

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
little we create a buffer zone for us a massive

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
biodiversity gain and so that's sort of what we're beginning to play

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
with we say things like if you took the entire world's population

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
today with seven billion of us. Living at the density of

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Manhattan not such a bad city to live in how much space to

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
seven billion people take up living at the density of

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Manhattan proper and then click the slide and it's the state of Colorado.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So again we love to share what the scientists are doing what

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
the experts are doing but as an artist. Maybe I can get you to think outside of the

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
box or to rethink what the problem could

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
be you. You see in relating your experience in college

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
you said I loved logic Mts computer programming I love

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
systems and logic approaches and so I just figured out that architecture is this perfect

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
combination and it takes me seven years of architecture school to

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
realize that I think making markets. What does it mean to

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
bring back

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
about why I think I think whenever you get up and. The whole architectural training

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.000
you actually get

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
up in front of your class

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in front of critics and you basically

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
have. I tell people why you do what you do all the time all the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
time and in our I think it's the zap opposite.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And it doesn't mean that one's more logical than the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
other we're making choices and everything we do with

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
we're sculpting our

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
paintings but we're not going to attempt and you would never dream to attempt to

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
delineate and explain why you're making that mark over that mark. So I

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
think the two sides of me and for some weird reason I think I ended up

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
with Bozo the left side

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and right side of the brain there. They're a little bit for both and so was for better or for

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
worse and for richer and

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
poorer. They kind of are diametrically opposed

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
at times and I'm I'm living in fear and I think the memorials are that in-between

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
ground because and I'm really trying to solve problems in yet at the same time you

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
have to let the poetry come

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
forward Piscator one said the two kinds of mindless proof you

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
know simply speaking to G M E T that to finesse and Geo

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
geometer A and in some sense the two

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
cultures came together in you and you then they're not

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
really fighting. They're not buying and trading but the but interested in the threshold but there's like

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
a

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
tension or I don't know whether I actually don't think there's any tension it's

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
like I don't know I'm you could say I was always interested in the boundary area between

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the two states but I actually love

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
architecture for its sort of

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
programatic functional aspects and I love art because it's

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
the exact opposite you just talked about the move a proven poet. Yes and I and I

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
think the

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
great fear and I think what I have to balance

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
is twofold one we've tended to live in a

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
very Ever since the industrial era we like to

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
compartmentalize so I was labeled as an architect and it took me years. Years

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
to figure out the I was they would call me much more

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
intuitive which I

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
think implies like there isn't a reason to what you're doing. I think there's just as much reason

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
but we're not going to speak about it we're not going to be able to define we don't lose any

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
more labels you know the labeling also happens

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
because of the people you bring us right it's a mixture you

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
know Napoleon once said to one of his generals he knew everything but nothing else.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And sometimes a very good sometimes very dangerous ways when we put in the small word that

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
was one kind of memorial resort. When I have seen marking then I would like to

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
to go through the landscape of many of you may remember it was

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
just a Civil Rights

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Memorial Montgomery Alabama built on commission by the Southern

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Poverty Law

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Center and they called me

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
up I had graduated from grad

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
school and I could not believe when they asked me that

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
there wasn't a memorial

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
to the civil rights era but at the same time I was very

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
reluctant to take it on

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
because I was hyper aware of where

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I was in my life and that if I took

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
this on

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
the labeling it would be just two fold but at the same time pride

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
for the same reason I designed the Vietnam while I Does the side of me that

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
has been very drawn to.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
History and learning and maybe it's because both my parents were

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
educators and the fact that I didn't realize until I started reading

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
about the civil rights era.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And this was like we were living through it and I wasn't understanding it is a kid and

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
I didn't realize that someone

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
was murdered for using the wrong color baton.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I didn't know this movement. I remember. In the eighty's I

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
think Eyes On The Prize come

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
out and people understand it but if you were growing up and being

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
taught history in the seventy's that was almost too soon.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
So part of me is realizing at that point

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
that if we can't remember it.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
How how can we even

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
learn from what the reluctance was and so that you would be speaking to some of the Arabs

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
whose name.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
No not at

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
all it was more the I just didn't want to you know

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
my whole life

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
that's she's the kid that designed the memorial. So doing another one is going

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
to different stance shoot that but at the same time I just felt

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
especially I start

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
researching it takes me one or two years to to research and

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I didn't presume to

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
know what the historians knew. So they assembled the

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Southern Poverty Law Center assembled everyone from Julian Bond to historians I can't

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
remember the Roy eight. And my only.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
My seeking for this was I knew very early on this this couldn't be just

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
about the martyrs the people killed it had to

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
teach a

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
brief history. So what you see at the beginning and it's

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
a it's a sundial effect it's a clock in a

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
way. And there's again we have are there to look a perfect. There's

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
a gap because with the Vietnam it's a book and the timeline

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
meets beginning and end of the war and meet with civil rights. There's

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
a gap signifying the time before in the time after that what we captured here was from one

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
thousand fifty four Brown versus

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Board of Education to sixty eight Martin with the King's

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
assassination as kind of the Cold

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
War. The history of what they would determine was this the civil rights

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
era at which point what you've got

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
is legislation. Have riots. You have someone's

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
death someone's death is sometimes caused because of legislation or right.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
But you begin to see as you walk around the the

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
timeline that this was a people's

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
movement that there are I think I can't remember how many

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
names but someone's death triggered either better legislation or

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the attempt at better legislation led to a riot led to someone's

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
murder and as you walk it by intertwining individual lives

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
lost with leisure special. You know political

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
events you begin to see how they're connected

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
and the worst of it was and I'll never forget we had to sit around the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
table

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
with the word murdered Lynch. How many times you could say killed.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
How do you do it factually How do you make it so you don't end up since satiate lies in

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
it because again I'm a firm believer

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
that if I step off my balance and I

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
become

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
emotional. And if the context becomes too emotional then

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
I'm not trusting the

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
viewer. To react and respond to it.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
These words when you read them for the first

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
time arrested

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
you say you know I find down to

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Montgomery on the first trip reading eyes on the prize and reading something I can't remember.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
And before I landed I came

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
across Martin Luther King quoting from the book of AMOS We are not satisfied we shall not be

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and I just this is

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
that intuition like you research something you put it all aside and something

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
just hits you and I knew the piece would be about

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
water before even the land it and I'll never forget it was the proverbial you sketch it out on a

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
napkin you give it to Morris Dees

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
and Richard Cohen who I just saw and you just know the piece would be

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
about that quote I don't know why.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.000
But

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
this is a recognition that happens

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
something strikes you and you don't know why.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And I don't want to know why I can you know when

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I but it's also what's what's interesting in your process for me is that

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
you immerse yourself in a lot of things that you know little about at

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
first and is such a pleasure. Not knowing.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
The historian where much of my name kind of Ginsberg who said that when he started his

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
research he starts from the point of view of the euphoria of ignorance.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Yes absolutely and that it's something

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
that I think we share but I mean it's certainly something that

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I I adore about what I do which is very speak to people all

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
the time who are so different and each time I have to immerse myself

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
in the I work as I did with you and here you are immersing

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
yourself in this worked and then you come upon that quotation.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And you know and you know what the book would look like in the woods in the way

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
he made the work realized in that fashion.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Yeah and also there is a site and that's Julian Bond and

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Rosa Parks so it was an incredible

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
moving. Dedication and I think McCann It

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.000
was you

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
know it was the pause it was packed. But there were also.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
State troopers on the rooftop because they were sort of afraid of

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
perhaps neighbors. I mean it was a little bit interesting I

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
mean you feel like you've participated in parts

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
of history that you almost can't. Describe in a way and then

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
someone staying to it but the whole crowd

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
just hushed because they thought maybe something happened. It was just the

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
heat of the day. But the funny thing with me is once I'm done with a project in this is a terrible

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
thing I kind of have to move on and right now

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
I am so my head is like my brain is ready to explode with facts

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
about sustainability and economics. Not that I can spout too much now but

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
just it's odd I compartmentalize and then I have to move

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
on and I've always been that

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
way but you you know you approach things

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
from you were mentioning earlier on that you were new dads you were growing up.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So you approached things wanting to really want to

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
understand what it is you work in museum

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
and it grew mines we have this idea that you want to get

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
to immediacy after

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
reflection right but it's

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
also you. I write a lot I research a lot I mean writing I'll just leave

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
shots down like there's been clues are

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
out in the book like the women's table I think I just wrote a spy of numbers to start

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
up again and then I basically have to put it all

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
away and then I usually go to the

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
site but then again with some writing.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Sometimes I begin with the writing I think for the sculptures I think the sculptures are with the ones that

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I often don't but the whole body of work is about sort

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
of studying terrain topography. I'll begin with

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
ideas of what I might want to try to say and then it all goes

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
away. And I wake up one

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
day and I usually it's after I've seen the

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
site with the women's table it was really funny

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
because they would call it three like three months

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
going

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
anything. New career. And then one morning I

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
woke up and I made this little model and it also lightly reminded me of a

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Modigliani face off on our on a base. I mean I

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
knew the timeline would be there because again I'm I've been obsessed

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
with. Time in all my works were in the memorials.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
But I didn't know the form that one

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
took a long time so for these works I don't work on

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
deadline because I don't believe well what if I had a

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
deadline and then I had to find a form before it found me.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I know that sounds a little strange but I kind of believe. Yeah. With

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
all that research at some

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
point so I put it all was something and something happens at night you

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
know when you Felipe or whatever you dream or whatever and it'll pop up but heaven

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
forbid because of the deadline. I had to force something out too

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
soon so I kind of I need that percolation

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
time for the for the memorials and I think you know missing.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I'm nowhere near even though the website is up it will keep on

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
changing it will keep on involving I write about it at the end of the book it's a

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
grill artwork in many shapes and forms and

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.000
but at the same

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
time have I done what I do normally no because I'm still so

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
much in the research mode and I've got two more years and then what will probably happen.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Well two more years because I think that's how long it's going to take me to to do

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
enough on green you're going to move.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I've had internal deadlines and I've been meeting the deadlines but the stripping down because

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
it's some point I'm going to want it to end up very

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
pure and more into pure poetry but not yet I'm not ready for

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
that because that's sort of the final and all the research and I tend to write a lot of

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
book with to understand what a project is so with missing will end up being like all of these

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
little bit of booklets that help me

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
see what I'm doing or trying to do but it's still

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
fairly obscure I kind of apologize for it at the end of and of

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
apologies work in progress girl are. It's kind of I'm building it in full

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
view and I keep.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Morphine it every every day I tend to surface on Earth Day because

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
otherwise you know I hide back about my hall.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
So this is my month of

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
getting the word out about what we've been doing with missing and.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And then I'll keep on working on it but we'll get back

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
to missing I'd like to take you down different projects.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Do you use very different

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
than was I you know in architecture and again because

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I do

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
art and the large scale environmental artworks in the shows. I'm

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
very careful when and what I take on an

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
architecture and it's very humble at times and for a moka Museum of Chinese in America which

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
is downtown. I have been trying to help out. Not for profit

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
organizations that I like or I believe in and so with Mocha my

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
mother would be so proud issue alive she sort of thought I probably

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
took thirty five years or forty years of kind

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
of not being exactly embraced scene of my

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Asian identity culture and I just

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
decided again how Porton it is. And

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
again it might be because as I've grown up I realize

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
this kind of dual identity has probably played into my

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
feeling of love of the opposite. So museum a Chinese in America. It says it's a

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
twelve thousand square foot museum downtown renovation of an old machine in

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
the World XI workshop. That is.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I'm on the board help them out ever since keep helping them and we did it on a shoestring.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
And I'm relieved I was doing architecture when for causes

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
from groups that might not have a lot of money but to me it doesn't mean you can't you can't do

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
something. You brought up your mother. And that she would be

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
proud of you

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
you could fund this magnificent quotation in that in an interview that you

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
did has been more years many many years

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
ago when you say you know I think my mother was born

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
in Shanghai. Oh I think

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
and she

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
was she was

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
you become more certain about that she would have been proud of

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
this of me kind of connecting to you as an angel sent to

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
the cultural identity because I think. And again and I think

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
the little bit of a phenomenon with immigrant parents both my mom and my

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
dad came from China.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
They fled as communism comes in they met in the States and they

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
never talked about. What it was like growing

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
up they never talked about it we never brought it up they would say well you never

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
were interested and we would say how could we

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
be interested in something

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
you did memory you know. And so one of these cans twenty two so I don't believe in

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
the return of the repressed you got incredibly And yeah we got really interested in it and so this is

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
just the interior and there's a hidden courtyard and we were able to walk

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
you around and again here comes the time line the inner courtyard which of my God.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
The first time I visited the site it was buried you couldn't even see the sky or Accord

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
or and the whole narrative history the arc of Chinese

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Americans coming to this country which actually starts very early on walks

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
that timeline and the film portraits you

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
see that was done with some local projects. And

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
management and matter the design from

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
literally Chinese immigrants have come out in waves. So in a

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
way the reflection of what was going on in

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
China as to why they immigrated in

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
that part of China. Coming out was very

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
different sort of like someone coming

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
from England or something Thomas and Spain but it's all considered China.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.000
But

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
what people don't know is that the islands were different why they came out the entire cultures. So

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
as you walk it you see this history revealing itself but as

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
you go down to the classrooms in the offices down below you actually

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
see the changing face of Chinese immigration through the

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
different eras as a family so I never thought I could play as much

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
with time and in a weird way some subtle symbolism

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
in the architecture so this was sort of a sweet project to

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
do my and let me take you on a on a journey which you know the novels for you OK but it's a

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
memorial that is incredibly important to me given my

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
family history.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
It's a memorial that an Israeli artist then the caravan did for then

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
to Binyamin and it's impossible to write the border

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
between France and Spain.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
He never made it and there's.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Great discussion whether he committed suicide or not but

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
this you know this with more I do know this incredible. Let me let me show you.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
The uniform.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Yeah I like that reaction. It is incredible to be

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
there

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
nearly escaped and so you you have you have

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
that the sea there.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
And the beyond which was not reached.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
It reminds me a little bit in a very very different but there are aspects of this

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
to Pinga son's memorial to that

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
supported it the tip of the ill the last detail. In Paris.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Which is what I've read the

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
words which was very moving and something I

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
had studied. Were

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
basically you have the names past a certain

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
point you can walk into this one area. God I can't recall

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
the quote there but it's a similar thing but all of these in a

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
way are about passages that you can get to a certain point.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
And then you see beyond but we're not allowed

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
to attain it whetted me it's a little like Hades. It's you Richey

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
it's Orpheus

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Descending having to turn around and come back that we're

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
not allowed. So these are

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
all there is really our Gorakh all these writings and a lot of ways and I you know

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
what I think. The

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Vietnamese face the same way it's this. I mean there isn't a view the ocean

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
but there is the reflection. So you see

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
yourself in through a mirror darkly.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
And you see yourself reflected in the names that this one it's all about the expanse but

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
again we're

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
not allowed

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
that that change they're trying to tell you

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
with yeah with Lieschen says it's from the concept

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
of history that Binyamin wrote a few months before dying.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
It is more difficult to honor the memory of anonymous than it is

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
to honor the memory of the famous.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
The historical construction is dedicated to the memory of

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
the nonmembers.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Can you say then

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
again you have to start it is more difficult to on of the memory of the non

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
the mess than it is to honor the memory of the famous.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
The historical construction is dedicated to the memory of

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
their moments right.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Most beautiful. It's to me though in a very funny

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
way the most moving memorials. Whether it's the memorials to

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
the

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
missing in World War one. Well you brought up.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Or

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
what you just read. It's of all about absence and it's about there

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
is in impossibilities that you absolutely can attain So this

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
is

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
this memorial which is Legends a memorial to the missing interior Paul France.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Is

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
very directly connected to my

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
design for the Vietnam

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Memorial not so much formally

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
but

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
but two fold on this if you go back one

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
image written in on the white

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
stone are the names of I think over one

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
hundred

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
thousand soldiers killed in one

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
battle over. I think it was a three day period in the battle of the

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
some and they're all missing.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Why are they missing because there are no dog tags.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
So I

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
had the you know. One Everyone knows the story. I designed

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
the memorial Vietnam

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
while as a class project in the class project as a senior at Yale.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.000
You

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
have.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
You have an option you can set up your own classes seven of us said we're interested

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
if you know the architecture the design we did right before

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
we decided let's let's design the Vietnam Memorial there's a competition that's a great word

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000
in school the assignment was to design a memorial to World War three.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
And so I had started studying all about memorials so you get back

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
into the thought about the same as versus the missing or

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
the

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
individual up until I would say the World War One memorials in Europe.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Memorials were always about the victor and frankly always about the

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
leader the foot soldier didn't

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
matter because up until modern times

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
individual lives soldiers one.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Really accounted

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
for got the man on the horse. We

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
won you get to except

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
for like the civil war in the U.S. We're

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
brothers from you know both sides were going to be listed in the town was

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
the memorials to World War One a war commission

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
was set up the wives lost I think it was

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
a one out of three. One out of four men in

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Europe and because there were no I.D.'s so many were missing

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
and you see and I studied there were

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
books put out we found a couple of the early volumes. These were

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
so powerful and I didn't quite understand why but I

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
just you know aside from the fact that they listed all the names but

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
these were not victorious these were like Vincent

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Scully described this is almost like a gay teen

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
scream that was a bombed out church in the town and this memorial was

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
in a way formally very much connected to that but

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
what happened was I had then designed the last project

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
after finding this in as I'm thinking about designs for World War

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
three

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
memorial. I had designed the memorial.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
And class was about to end or class it ended and Scully

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
if you go back one in the spring semester

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
I designed it in the fall of eighty. I had a

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
senior seminar

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000
with the NZ unscholarly and he starts talking about how you

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
go up to this memorial from the opposite side you have to cut through.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
A

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
simple one of grass so you know what violating that space you get up

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
you're inside this gaping screen you're working

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
now on one hundred crosses and a hundred tombstones of the

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
British and the French you're not allowed to go down

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
into that space that you have to now turn around and go back and as he's

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
describing this journey to an awareness of

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
was and that again there you have it you can't attain it.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I'm starting to write furiously in what I write I end up writing on the

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
boards that I would that I'd then decide to submit because. I just wanted

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
to kind of I don't know make a statement but

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
that's sort of why this piece has been so important to me. Vince was always a

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
little curious because for me they couldn't be more

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
different but then I finally wrote about it anyway.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
You

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
see at the memorial it's tapping

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
into some very important. I would say

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
ancient

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
needs. Yes.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Very I think again as you as you are starting

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
in how we mourn. I was very

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
acutely aware how America's very young.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
And we tended to be very afraid of a gene of

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
dying that earlier cultures have always not just embraced

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
death but that the dying is so much a part of a

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
ceremony of wife that there's much more of an acceptance of it and up more of it maybe not

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
in is part of

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
life and that we're very young culture and we almost hit away

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
the age you feel because of that. Yeah I think it's used so I think we're just a very

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
young country still are maybe we're going through are all kind

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
of are you know. We have such screen tricks suppressions you know when you want to

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
see in the American English language is something you see relevant.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
You see that's history right. We have no use.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
It's rather high and no I mean I think it's like think of it like probably right now we're in

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
our

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
awkward adolescence and you know as a country. No we

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
were very afraid and you

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
know so I designed this thing

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
and. The names.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
BEGIN and END. The the apex sort of the closed book.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000
So it is that close timeframe. But again what you have is.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Not so much an

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
object inserted to the earth but I've always seen the site you cut the earth you polish its edges it's

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
a geo. But what I've really done is by going down ten feet at the

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
apex you create this quieting sensation as you go lower

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
and lower the sounds of the city because Constitution Avenue is right there it's really

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
noisy actually that drips drops

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
away. And you don't have a sense as much that your going.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
You're descending but the names are rising up so

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
psychologically and you were kind of walking

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
into another world that you can see it's like

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
that image of our world again through

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
a glass

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
darkly. And then you have to turn around and walk into the light. You have to turn

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
around and walk back. So it is

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
that journey turn around. With whatever you do so you write your future and

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.000
I

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
think obviously for me the fact that

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
I made it a chronological wish to

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
name again.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Is all about the reality of the time

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
and again trying to capture the factual. Nature

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
of the situation. So any

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
veteran who spent time in the war would come back

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
and within one or

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
two pages. Of that was

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
the find their time and of course find their colleagues. So even though there

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
are no names aren't there they are there back in their time units and I had to

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
fight really hard because first they really did not want the

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
name chronological they wanted them. Alphabetical because they

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
thought how are people going to find the name they're going to stick

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
time to work and I said well they will want to take that time because that becomes a

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
ritual of understanding and of remembering. And then

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
I keep all reads remembering also that the word remembering is really

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
remembering putting the members back together.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Absolutely yes and I and I also think it's

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
like a name brings back everything you know about the

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
person. So is it really that

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
abstract the timeline makes it actually very real and a funny thing the time it's

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
important and

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
then it's also the scale is hugely important the lettering is

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
like less than half an inch high. So what you've got is a book put

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
out in full view but it's still a book and we all have to

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
read books one on

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
one you see I like to think of my work as

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
creating a private conversation with each person no matter how public.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Each work is and no matter how many people

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
present rush to to my mind it's very consonant with his

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
idea book because yeah. In some sense we're never more alone than we were

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
when we're with the book I'm a more

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
compromise and it's very personal and yet no matter how public so I don't actually think of any

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
of my works in terms of how many people or how public a space

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
is I'm probably like that.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
And that's all I'm after is what one person is going to do when they touch

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
or experience. One of my pieces and touches that's important units. You

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
know you can't see it without touching it in my

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
opinion.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Right

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
I just wanted people to. Know I like

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
to think everything I do you know I try to say I just have to touch that I just have to see

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
it which is interesting because museums as we were all about not.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I know it's like now you get a sense of this is for me at least for sculpture it's like you want everyone to

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
like connect to it was the first. Yeah that's you know it's pastel dry

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
and I think one of the jurors said he must really know what he's doing to there to do something

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
that he had the any idea. Of you know.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
When he was I was I was still in college when

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
it came out so yeah it was sort of

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
interesting anyway a long time ago when you expect. Do you do

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
you ever wonder what would have happened if this hadn't happened to you.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
You know

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
you were Yeah of course we all do it's like you know every

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
time you have a moment in life and you take a different turn. I mean I

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
think it

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
probably knowing that it happened. I did everything

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
I could to pretend it hadn't by going right back into grad

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
school and I

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
think I'll never forget I got

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
out of grad school pop to the next slide and see

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
what's next now after that now. Either way. Either way

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
guys now.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Shawn and scarce know you can't go to then I want to get past them was

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
yeah. Where was

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
I You were asking me to go back

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
and forth. Oh yes I want to get past. Yeah people

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
we do want this is interesting. Oh.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Interesting to me is where I think it is yes I think it is when you think it is

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
where I think it is I'm sure

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
you. This is from Beijing. OK.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
It's amazing. Story beer.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
The family story has a family. You must tell it.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Just too extraordinary and also the fact that in your family

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
you're carrying around this region see for memorials

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
in the most central location when possibly

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
imagine this. So this is a forbidden city or no it's not it's the

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
big tournaments. He and a minister and my

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
on the

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
eldest daughter of

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
my Qur'an and

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
father my father's half

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
sister.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
That was a certain time in China and my father was the

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000
first born son eldest son of the Serb wife.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Lynne way yeah. Is that what I wanted you to

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
get my. On to Lin way yeah

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
and very well known very beloved in China

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
almost like it's the soap operas about her and T.V.'s and movie says about her

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
is the daughter of the second wife and there was a

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
first wife who had no children.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
So everybody was obviously in the way even I had

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
a architecture teacher at Yale King Louis Woo who came up

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
to me and said I.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I mean and he still had a crush on her and and

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
managers adored her and she was she married lengths to change but she had

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000
a certain magnetism to the point where they both came out to study architecture in the

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
States. To get to you pan and she's told well we don't accept

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
women and within a year he's teaching at the school she just

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000
had something with her

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000
and this is it she was modern She was

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000
smart she she and her husband end up cataloguing

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
a lot of the ancient. Architectural style of China they went all

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
around documenting it that manuscript was lost for many years their

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
friends Wilma and drawn their banks found it and published it. It's got a pictorial

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
history of Chinese

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
architecture and she and her husband

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
reign

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
in the States they bring modernism back to China. There

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
are firm nationalists they believe they were going to go

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
back and help out China and they pretty

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
much helped engineer Tiananmen

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Square and she created this monument in in Tiananmen Square.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
I think she also had a huge say

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000
in the Chinese flags from certain reports.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
I didn't know about this history. My father

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
though adored. His sister

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
adored her and so desperately wanted a girl.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
So my brother's born. Brother's older than

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
me and he.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:31.000
You know he wanted a girl. So it's very not the Chinese like the assumed.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
The father wants the son it's like he just wanted the girl because he's so adored win win.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
And then I you know. Flash forward we're in

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
D.C. it's some function he's come in and my dad is talking

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000
on and on with the then ambassador from China and at

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
the end I'm going What were you guys talking about and only then does my

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
dad begin to reveal the

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
family history I think. Grandfather helped draft the first constitution in

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
China that I had this aunt and she was actually well known too and it was kind of

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
this

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
interesting.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Piece that was not in my life and what piece missing. But there was a

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
whole undercurrent were my father was just

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
so in a way it's almost like he gave me a sort of strength because I

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
almost got this favoritism.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Sorry time. My

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
brother because he was just so adoring of her and it was just

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000
it was sort of in a very empowering. But again that history was

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
kept from you it was absolutely. Yeah

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000
yeah except for the fact that anybody that he almost empowered

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
the daughter to have this sort of favorite son status that was a funny

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
thing to be in what I thought was really funny is without knowing it.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
We

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
were connected. Yeah you know. And I remember

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
a history professor at Yale Jonathan Spence was like telling me

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
and showing me pictures of Groucho wonderful men and.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
And it's it's

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
just kind of a funny irony.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
You know so this Chinese president is discovering also Japanese

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.000
yen sensibility. In this project. And somewhere you know connected

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
to I think I never could figure out how much I responded much

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
more in a way to Japanese architecture to its simplicity until.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
My mother and I were in China this is one of my first art installations so

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000
this is one thousand nine hundred three is for the Webster Center for the arts. I

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
was invited to install a permanent work first permanent work I think at the Workers

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Center and the Webster Center was designed by Peter Eisenman And he

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
combined two grids go back one

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
slide and do. When So if you walked into the front

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
entrance and one level down in the cafe you were met with a concrete

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000
and empty ninety feet wide kind of an impossible residual

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
space filling up with cigarette. Whatever the wind would blow

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
in and I had been working in my studio with broken glass which you

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
could never put it out in a public space because it's broken glass it is tempered glass but

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
it's technically still not something you

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
could put out where kids could play with it and I took one look at the space and

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
I said I know exactly what I want to do forty three tons

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
of broken car

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
glass. And White having a

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
glass because broken car glass with Gouin it was tinted green

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
and then the patio glass again

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
recycled was white and I had

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.000
the color it was called Color the recycled color guys poured

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000
into these massive dump trucks equally on both sides

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
so that when it would pour out in these

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
buckets with the crane bucket. When I get

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
the color of water which is what I really wanted to do I gave myself seven

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
days. Working with the team.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
To make the piece

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000
with barely a sketch because as I once I got out of the grad school. I

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
began to

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
realize how much I was splitting my time between my

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
architecture and my art and it's probably always been this way full

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.000
disclaimer my

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Japanese do you know fine I know when to be really you

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
know. More the disclaimers that your father was was a ceramic

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
rather misses and he

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
was the school of art was my playground so I was like casting

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000
bronzes by the time I was in high school and I just I don't think

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
I ever was not making something but my mom was a little bit of an academic snob it had just

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
a bit I would go into something

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:02.000
my dad was doing because he only got a man. It's just to be nice to get a doctorate. So there's

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
a really academic

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
side and then there was my dad it was like. You know cigarettes being cool being the

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
SO wellness this and the two sides are like oil and water at times

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
I don't remember in what passes you talk so movingly about your

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000
father's Oh yeah it was in boundaries

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000
and he.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
He was this incredible ceramicist and

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
he could pull upon the lens of his own

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
arm beautiful slender always ceramic goys

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
where Stone pottery glaze wears

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000
and. I grew up with him having that ability and at a certain

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
point he gave it

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
up and he started first and became director of the

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
school of art then he became dean of the School of Art and I couldn't figure out how a potter

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000
was so good at balancing the budget and. And he was really tough like I think

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000
they were all so happy when he retired because he always got the most money for the school of the

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
art at Ohio University and what again. He never offered and they would

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
say we never asked. He fled China mid

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.000
career and when he was a teenager or high school or.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
He really wanted to go into ceramics his parents had an

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
incredible ceramics. Collection that when the Japanese invaded.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
A lot of it was

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
taken at that point and he wasn't allowed to so he goes into

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
academic administration and becomes like Secretary of fukin university he comes out.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:41.000
He's

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
probably almost forty. Goes to University

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
of Washington start studying

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
ceramics but he was trained as an academic administrator. So you get

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
stone you hired as a ceramicist and little by little move

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
back into. DEMICK administration. Partly because

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
he liked it partly because he wanted to make more money so he could

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
put my brother and I through

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
college and by the time he returned to ceramics

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
after he had retired he had developed a little bit of our writers and my dad was

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
a perfectionist and he just made all these

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
pots and he never glaze them because he just they weren't good enough for

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
him so we still have them and one day when I run I always talk about who could we

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
get to work with us so maybe glaze them or maybe it's best to just

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
leave them with you and ways. I don't know it's probably they just

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
sit in storage meetings is something I don't know what. But he was

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
an incredibly skilled

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
ceramicist and his hands were so I was when

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
he'd passed away I was not there and I rushed out and I got

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
to the funeral home and I just saw

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
him lying in state and I just walked in his hands and this was

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:07.000
a

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
tough could be very formidable like the jeans. He was

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
a tough teen and. And I always thought of my dad as being

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.000
very kind

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
of we would yell. I mean he would yell it.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Professors yell it but President to get more money it's like he was a tough guy and I'm

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
looking at his hands and his hands are

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
incredibly

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
delicate and there are incredibly elegant and they're incredibly long and I

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
just looked and

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I I just realized I he gave me his

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
hands and you just see this guy is being like this cool

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
roughs kind

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
of you like the from B.P. has never looked to the fans like oh

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
my god they're like So how again would you know it was discovered that I know it was

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
a very strange moment because I'm sort of like.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You know. Tragic. I'm really torn up but at the same time it's like you're making

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
a connection and I think we just don't

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
know you can live with your pain. You don't know who your parents are because we're

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
just when we're kids we're just not looking at life that way and maybe when you

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
have kids and you reflect back. But yeah that was a kind of

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
an amazing man to look through a number of things quite quickly

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
in the interest of because sometimes this

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
was part of the first thing was left of center and then I've done. Maybe five six.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
One woman shows and this was part of a show called systematic landscapes where

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I took a mountain range that I knew that I hike every summer called Blue

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
wakes and I pulled it apart and this in a way

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
is directly inspired by some of

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
John McPhee

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
S writings where he talks about going through. I don't know if it was the Cumberland Gap I can't remember who

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
was in Basin and Range where you're driving through these cut and the way

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
the sedimentation

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
has been up and lifted. So often as opposed to seeing the stratified WAYS OF

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
THE EARTH WIND flat. They've now risen up when you're driving

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
through and the stratified waves are now almost perpendicular to the

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
your ground plane. So if you go back one and see the detail. This is out of

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
formaldehyde free particle board and I took the terrain map

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
so I created this topography and I deliberately

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
stacked and had plywood the metal

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
glued vertically that way and I

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
left just enough space about thirty inches so you can kind of fit

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
through the maze and each each piece is like

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
thirty six by thirty six so the massing is larger than the space between

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and you kind of get wedged through it as you

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
go through it and when you mention someone like like John McPhee You know those writing.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And so far you know the word. Yeah. And

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
so I had asked in to apologies. Because I couldn't resist

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
boundaries which was the first book I wrote because I really felt writing was almost

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
like sketching for

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
me this is the Caspian Sea which is again

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
we're very visual a lot of my artwork focuses on natural

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
phenomena but again maybe getting you to think about something you're not thinking

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
of and we tend to think of the surface of the water we're really thinking of what's below. So

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
this began to play with pulling in the depths of bodies of water

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and sexually part of a series called bodies of water. This is a piece

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I just completed it's still up at the Renwick there are a nagual

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
reopening in our

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
first the Renwick is our first museum and if you go back one.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It's the Chesapeake Bay It's called Fold in the

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Chesapeake but the Renwick is a very historic building and I

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
took one look there are nine artists in this group so it's the show's called

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Wonder and.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And I just took a drawing of the Chesapeake that I drew I folded

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
up the edges of the paper and I said well what if I just ignore the architecture of the room

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and just let the piece flow from the floor to the walls up to

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
the ceiling. You can pop to one more.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And so I don't know if there's a third one that details now go back and it

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
is about.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I love in my are to kind of look at

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
waterways terrain. So in a funny way. Sometimes I'm a bit of a

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
cartographer I go to the Strand I buy used atlases and.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's a little like I don't Matic drawing but how does this gum surgery on

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
me made me think of what you saw in Yarosh

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
a lot for allies and so I would say

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
about twenty years ago fifteen years ago I started buying up used out.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Says and what I love

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
is you follow follow with an exacto blade.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Landscape

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
terrain up until you get the to the United States and ways in

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
which we could measure by hubris just measure us

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
square cities states territories followed more

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
natural boundaries.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So the idea is once I start drawing and you're kind of following

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
both the natural borders

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and political borders and then I'm just making a

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
landscape within hidden away in atlases. Again and then

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.000
this is

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
the pin. These are pin Rivers waterways. This is at the

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
U.S. consulate in Beijing and if you go back

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
one it is the Yangtze River. So

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I like looking in and grounding

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
people in what is literally right under their feet.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I also love focusing on rivers because we tend

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
to again we're incredibly territorial we we see what we

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
know and we know along the river where we live.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Maybe if someone's polluting upstream we'll think about what's up

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
there to start to what was the good don't get you know we

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
don't tend to worry about what's downstream from us so a lot of these rivers and waterways are

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
beginning to get you to see these rivers

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
as unified holes.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And this one I love. Again underwater to rain this one was

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
called waterline only the top two feet was

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
above ocean level it's the I want to Bouvier and it forms this

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
complex terrain and I just. Again I think eighty five percent

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
of the world is covered by water our most complex mountains

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:03.000
are underwater the tallest mountain in the world. Isn't Everest it's Hawaii.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And so often times in my

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
ARE I'M TRYING TO partly I just want to look at it because

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I'm just paying attention and then partly I want to tweak people

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
because again if we can if I can suspend disbelief if I can get you to look at

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
something for the first time again were

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
a very is a chance.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Interesting because when we're kids we look at something and we

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
really look at it we miss we're we've never seen it

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
before so we spend a lot of

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
time fascinated by really simple things and as we grow

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
up and as we know

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
more we absolutely. Stop looking because we already have this

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
background of

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
knowledge then when I was receiving it. You need to use yes to respect its

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
immediacy its empathy

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
is that your moment of experience and it's

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
very non restaurant schol especially in the art but

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
even within the history works the memory works.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I'm just trying to get you to see a pure fact in front of

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
you rather than referencing it to something outside that was around and I think

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
a lot of the minimalist artists. I think it was Robert Morris wrote this

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
great essay called the present tense of space Irwin

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
talks about it in our Weschler talks about it once was

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
heard and seen forget it seen as forgetting the name of this thing one sees if you can

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
arrest any sense of reference and you can pull

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
someone into

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
that immediate. Pure experience and I'm drawn to

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
that when it's in the stars unsure of soils so.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I don't know what's Well you know you because you were talking about

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
childhood a desire. You know the right.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
You will mention MORRIS There's a line in human veil I've always loved we should close

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
with pension reform with pray you.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Write anything is it will help you type of you can get lost in the moment. You're right you're getting

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
lost and you hope for it.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Yes always and I think partly I want

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
to I want to get lost in that moment I'm a little hyper. I'm a

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
little way

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
hyper so my work is a lot

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
calmer than I would ever be it's really sad because that's how you have to write

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
through all right I'm so tired because it's one thirty two and

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I will never know if I wanted to show we have been doing and when he

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
goes yeah this is I just completed it you get a sneak

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
peek of what's inside but basically no one else will for a while it's Novartis

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
is research labs in

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Cambridge that we have built the only architecture project I took on from two

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
thousand and nine till last year I'm now working on Smith's library

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
in Northampton if you go back one.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So and go back another now go. OK So this is a good side.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So the start of it there's a lower section because everything along mass I have

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
is four stories and then there's a taller tower which is all the research

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
labs and from the beginning I based the entire patterning which is

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
that stone it's a floating stone sunscreen

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
wall the stone is Chelmsford it's literally quarried fifteen minutes away

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
from downtown

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
mass and it's patterning is based on a

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
microscopic view of bone.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And if you go back one what I was trying to express was in

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
medicine. Scientists are

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
always learning from nature taking from nature and then

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
systematizing nature. So

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
the pattern of the glass

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
tower. Is almost up patterning it's got seven

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
different levels of fritted glass to begin to get that play of depth.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It's all in one plane and again it's this kind of symbolic I will do you

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
feel that what we learn from in

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Nature Medicine does exactly that it. Then tries to

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
make compounds tries to make scientific sense of it and then the heart and

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
spirit of the building is you've got the whole lower what I call the boomerang section if you go go

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
back one

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
time. So everything on mouth there. This was the

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
last on built a band in this parking lot area a

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.000
long

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
mass between. MIT and Harvard.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Cambridge wanted everything on the street to be given back.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
As we tell to bring life to the city which was great but then how do

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
you make a front entrance to

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
this building so that whole canopy is your entry into

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Novartis into a public park. It's a one point five acre public

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
park during the day anyone can use and then it's a compound of to leave

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
buildings that I sort of designed the first building

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
which And then the second building is to seek a mores and the

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
third is a two story structure that had to remain

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
its with any

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
computer. Was invented. So you

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
had two stories for stories and then we could go to eight stories so I had to

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
again very interested in keeping the scale of the story and the human scale

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
of

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
that street taking and not overpowering this two story historic

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
building and then still going of course of artists to

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000
build a research and for me it was an articulation between conference scene and meeting

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
rooms down below and then this is just the sneak peek of the inside it's

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
of Sadia that how do we

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
get. The goal. What one of the major goals was how do you get the scientists out of their labs and.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Out of their silos and talking to one another or so the whole the

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
whole the

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
whole what we call the war

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Boomerang has all those meetings conference and the whole place becomes a very almost a

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
campus like socializing field. You can go on and talk about larger scale. Yeah

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
yeah a Levon minute wine.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Very interested in taking a little bit of

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Ohio in transplanting it to southern Sweden.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Because I'm

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
from southeastern Ohio and there are these

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
incredible effigy mounds of which one is literally called the Serpent Mound

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and it has a snake about to eat in the Hague and when

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
the European settlers first came

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
to the new world and they saw these mounds and they

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
went well certain way that Native American tribes here could not possibly have been

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
this this is to Katyn Europeans must've come

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
from Europe. Made these and then gone back to Europe.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
So what I figured I do and I get very interested in

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000
the nature of a line drawing like this one to me was the little

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
prehistoric I wanted to take a little bit of Athens Ohio and move it to southern

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Sweden it's

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
the part of them the fact my sister is a state everyone

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
else has their artwork. There's an incredible barn that Anne

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Hamilton to over. Martin

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Prue has this. Unbelievable statue almost boodle like

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
shape hidden in a Beech Grove. But I just needed more

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
space so when I do these large outdoor works I need a little bit of elbow room go

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
back and so I'm very busy. This was the here.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
This was a cow pasture and it was owned it's one of the oldest.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Operating dairy farms

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
in all of Sweden and so I asked.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Marie. Can I Can

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I play in the field and just sort of water now. We have to ask

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
the what do you call that the dairy man. If the cows

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
would mind

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
and it sort of brings back memories of

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
your childhood. You know you your father and mother thinking that you

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
knew when to feed the

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
animals yeah and then there I am where you are again in a state of the art

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000
sustainable organic dairy and the cows actually love the climate and walk on it.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Don't know why. So this is another piece part of

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
a series called The Wave guilds there's three in

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
this series they'll be three in the earth drawings and they're all based on I

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
came across this one

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
photo of a repeating water wave in this is the second called Flattr it's

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
a very shallow wave. It's when water comes almost to shore and

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
it causes ripples in the sand.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
This was the first in the series it's ten thousand square feet scale is you could

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
sit back and look

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
to fast. Just mind. OK. You

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
can sit in a wave and read a book and go to the last of the culmination of this series

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
because this is all plain about scale you can go pop forward Storm King wave

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
field and

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
again I think the reason I end up making so many of the works in the studio is because when

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
you're out there and full scale. They're not letting me near the

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
bulldozer operators it's like they're going to we're sculpting

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
it. But I

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.000
can't do it my hands aren't doing it at that point and so this was just

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
the beginnings of it and we

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
built the whole piece out having modeled it model that this is the Storm King aren't

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
center and I realized once I built it. I had gotten the scale wrong

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
for the site. The idea was I'd go from ten thousand square feet for the first wave

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
feel thirty thousand in this was ninety the ninety thousand wasn't big

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000
enough to fit the site and so we had. Then increase each

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000
wave by about five feet. So it went from twelve feet to eighteen feet and in doing

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
that every single row had to grow.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
He was great. That's my at this moment in

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
time I'm basically saying I think we need to scale

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
the project up which meant every wave but the

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:30.000
first had to get done. He smiled and said sure.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
The

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
remounts later. You know and so this was I was driving up the Storm King like

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
almost every other day to help.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
We held our breath and we had to talk about the library in the library

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
and talk with you

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
brother and yes my brother tahn is when my older

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
brother is a language pilot

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
and I spoke yesterday to a poet to to me is a very good

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
blues very good poet in these are much smarter than me.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Really intellectual too

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
and but really for your father. You had to do exactly what

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
it my mom who's a poet and a professor and my brother were like perfect and my

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
dad and I were off making clay

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
things. My brother probably

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
was instrumental we all talk about how. Our parents influence

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
us my brother did I mean he would put out like easy poets like Merwin

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
and then came Ashbury and then came Stevens and I could tell

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
you what they meant but I just fell in love

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
with. Poetry in high school

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
and always just was inspired

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000
so and we knew so extraordinary in terms of trees and nature.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Yes I was out there playing in the woods and my brother was writing like crazy

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
and so this is called reading a garden and the title of the piece is spelled backwards

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
on a water fountain. So when you see the

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
reflection in the water it spells itself. Forward

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and it's my brother's poem and it's a child's verse it's almost like Alice in Wonderland

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
because

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
this space was between the old historic library in a new library in the children's

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
school library was right at the base of the new library. So we created

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
this three part little.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Home game garden that you playfully walk through or

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
on and it's just called reading the garden and

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and there were be times where I created the form and then my brother wrote the

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
poem and then I would change the form

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
because what you didn't want to do like with anything I'd done before with civil rights I came up with

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
the form and then applied the words with this piece I wanted to start saying well what is the arc.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
What is the space changes

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
to the

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
language

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and so this again and this is sort of my idea of how I start thinking of like the spiral

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
me is a beginning because it was women it yell. It's not a

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
memorial it's just merely.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Kind of commemorates co-education at Yale and on this water

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
table is a spiral of numbers starts with zeroes and that with the year

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I put it in which is I think ninety three and of course

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
when there were no women at

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yale at the beginning. So it's a bunch of zeros to you get to like eighteen

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
thousand eight hundred seventy whatever. And there is the number thirteen.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And that's like the first graduate

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000
school to admit women it was a Yale School of Art Street all in the rumor

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
was though I've also been told that's not true Mr Street had two daughters and he gave money

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
to build St hall under one condition that it decodes from the start

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
and

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
so again here's a timeline the last of the way the timelines

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
and it's completely open ended because you can have a beginning.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
You know when yell starts to admit women but you don't have. And the time

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
that I came across one

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
book and they gave women the names silent

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000
listeners because women were allowed to audit courses at the start but they

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
weren't allowed to enroll. And then one officially. Admitted women into

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
the undergraduate

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000
class they did so under a very strict quota. So what we

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
tried to do and I had to use the Yale strict statistics department

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
and there's a footnote. I love it if I can put like an ass tricks but

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
no on an artwork because the stats department said

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
well we can give you an approximation. But it's an approximation. Because in the Yale

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
School of Law they officially admitted

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
women but they didn't want to admit they admitted

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
women. So they left them isn't this all.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
So they don't know how many women and they had to do an

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
extrapolation

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
on the initials to assume what percentage may mean.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
So there's a little footnote on the back that sculpture that kind of because the stats departments you have to

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
you have to like to explain as

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
you know looking Yes you mean a source who is thinking of the recent

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
past and

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
just how I mean how much of this is me

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:19.000
people speak

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
about the poor create a few architects of the women.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000
It's amazing the number of women that train in architecture.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
In my whole training

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.000
has been at least. You know forty percent fifty

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
percent sometimes more at times and then it's really hard.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
They don't end

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
up becoming their

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
own firm. I've seen we've been architects get

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
relegated

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
to the managerial

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
rules versus the creative and you don't know why.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
In closing my. A project that is very close to you.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:01.000
This is

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000
the well these are sculptures this was at the Paris This is AROUND THE WORLD times three in it's

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
the Arctic.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I was going to miss latitude. Introspecting New York and then

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
the equator. So this is the terrain above and below sea level and then if you

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
go on I'm very interested in just again the mountain

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
ranges I'm really interested right now

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
in the deepest crevices in the ocean as well as there was a headline

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
that came

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
out three days ago about you know the and.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Antarctic in the Arctic. The

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Antarctic disappearing this is this is go back one this

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000
is the diminishment of the Arctic ice cap.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So it's lost about fifty percent of its mass

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
what isn't told is it's the amount of debt that has been lost as the ocean

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.000
waters

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
underneath are carving it out so I think a lot of the comments are

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
from the scientists is they had to be

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
very conservative. That's just the nature and their role.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
It might be the concern is that this is going to happen much faster as the ice

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000
starts melting and and a Swiss cheese effect starts happening. And if you go I

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
think if we pop to the next one this

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
is I took one piece

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
of Vermont marble and yeah. Always you're allowed

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
to touch this and week out of one piece we carved out. So the

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
uppermost layer

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
layers were what's left. So if you go into a detail of it.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
So this is called the disappearing bodies of water and like to show the air of

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
the Lake Chad which are almost nonexistent as waterways so I'm

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
very interested right now and diminishing our call for is

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
in the polls. I think I'm beginning to start to build.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Words. Than that show which will try again i was take two years.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
You know as I hope to be able

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
to use you back to the library

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
because I'm going to probably be doing a big project with the

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
the Danish royal library on the Arctic

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Circle is seventy where my meeting

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
subject and politically. If you can believe it.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
How many countries are now battle when.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Because they think with all the ice disappearing they can go

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
ocean exploring for more oil or have a I mean we're we're

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
we're insane. Well you know I mean we don't do that in that sense art

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and I'd like to see come together for you

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
as with yes in the art and maybe it's always been that way I think I've always been a little bit

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
on the political side. I just try to be

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Nanda Dak To kick step with Messina or I become a little

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
prescriptive hopefully when I'm done I'll strip it back to something else but part of it will

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
remain extremely prescriptive extremely didactic I'm not going to get

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
out there with missing telling you what is gone without telling me what we can do to

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
help

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
because I think it's our

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
time our kids are going to suffer it. It's not going away to our

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
grandkids it's now and we have to move and so this this is what young

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
people in

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Mount one week ago today.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Yeah and I thought clipped it and I'm into that made with

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000
obsessed with like right now I'm going to start working on a sculpture that deals with

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
they have all the data

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
of of them the mountain range underneath the Antarctic.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
One of my piece is going to be about an

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Antarctic without ice not that there will always be ice there.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
If if and when the climate models are saying it's going to once it starts it goes quite.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Quickly I think though there was one ice shelf the Weddell ice shelf in the

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Antarctic it first signs of thought when it went it would

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
take decades and

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
it can get within two

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
months and that

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
was just two hundred twenty years ago and other people filmed it was

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
stunning and so when the Antarctic goes I think it's going to increase

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000
sea level by twenty feet but the trouble is that the Arctic

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000
going and Greenland that could really set us over. So this is happening

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
in

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
our now and it's again as Al Gore would but when you put the

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
lobster in cold water and you turn the heat up slowly but you

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
barely notice that So again we have a very

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
weird inability to see something happening right in real

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000
time when it's kind of not immediately fire

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
to put out it's a little bit of a

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
slower situation and that's the problem

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
and also with shifting baselines we just don't realize how much

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
is change because we just accept what we what we have in front of us. So yeah

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I'm obsessed. I'm really I

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
mean this is it's this it's ocean of things that if occasion it's

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
it's the sixth extinction

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
it's all happening. But I'm ultimately I

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
mean I'll say it it's

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000
like the World Economic Forum said it would take seven hundred billion

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
annually to curb climate change

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000
missions. That's less than what we spend annually. On cigarettes

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:45.000
or I put up another factoid you combine what we spend on the weight loss

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
industry and. I can't remember any meetings in the US that seven

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
hundred billion meetings in the US. You

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
mean people going to meetings going to meetings which I've always wondered. Yeah of course one more

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
thing no two

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
more or forget this. If you want to protect all of biodiversity it would be

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
like seventy five billion a year and that's what we spend on pet

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
food on that new plan that we know very well you're going

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
to.
