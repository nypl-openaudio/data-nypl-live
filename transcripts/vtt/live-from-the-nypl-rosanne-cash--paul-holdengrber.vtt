Roseann Ruthann. Pleasure to have you here. Thank you I'd like to

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
begin by quoting a line you haven't composed that I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
really

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
love. It's kind of a line

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to the poets you say

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Someone once told me to perform to the six percent.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If the audience of the audience who are poets.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I have this in mind at some point. Every time I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
sing but I often have to find that six percent by looking past

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
those who are your naming glazed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
over

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
distracted and settled those who come to try

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to look through me to see my

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
dad and those who can't respond to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
music but like the experience of sitting in a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
crowd with

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
those who can. Like you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to comment on this a little bit you know and I

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
might add by saying that on this very stage I once had Van

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Cliburn and he said something not dissimilar he said he always

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
tries with his mom and dad's tremendously long

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
hands to reach out in the middle of the crowd of the audience of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the public to see how they are feeling how they are trying. How would how they

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
are

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
responding take the temperature. Yeah yeah that I do that show.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I. I sometimes imagine that if it's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
not it's difficult to know if I'm late for going through mud or I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
can't find the connector point. I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
imagine pushing to the far rafters to the back

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
corners and. Coming back from there to try to find a way to connect I mean

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
it's not much of why that why the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
poets wife or your wife write Yeah because they're listening.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The poets are left.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's of such a good

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
response you know it's summer on a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Blackberry and then some are listening and it's generally the poets are those who have

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
a poetic spirit who are listening.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We just we just were in the rear book room in the big

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
collection. And you you wanted to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
put your hands on what. The First Folio.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Of Shakespeare.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You know just just just to make just to make that clear

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and on the specific passage.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Well I wanted to touch Henry the fests the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
prologue where the narrator says he sets it up by saying Oh for

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a muse of fire that would ascend the brightest heaven.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So I have that on my phone and I read it a lot just that while I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
know from use of fire that what isn't the brightest talent I mean yes we all want

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that don't sell I wanted to touch

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that panel why did you want to touch that because why bad why that book

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
why there was something you really wanted to capture that moment with your

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
fingers because it's four hundred years of history in that

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
folio and all those Shakespeare himself wouldn't have touched it because it

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
was printed after his death his friend Ben Jonson probably

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
did touch it

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
so and when we came down the youth said to me

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Ben Jonson

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
mayhaps touch up to you and you was

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
so excited. I can

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
feel my hair standing on the back of my neck just a talk. About it because he knew Shakespeare he was his friend

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
he wrote that beautiful ode to him in the front of the follow. So

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and he

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
was you know hands on involved in creating the folio so maybe he touched

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that one and you know four hundred years of history

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and the original actor's names listed in

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
there were real people this is not some vague idea you

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
know it's a real thread. It's a real

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
threat. It's really something that is being

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
transmitted and it reminded me of a passage I often think about

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of Henry James where he says I delight in the visit to Bill ten

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Gibble

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
palpable powers. I delight in that.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I don't know if we have it here but if we do you will have you touch it you know

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
well

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
now you know there's another part about the past. Actually it's about

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
time I think it was Stuart Wilder he

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
said time is not a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
river but a landscape that you step in and out of you

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
can move in a lot of directions and I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
find. I find that to be true and.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Writing and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
performing you find that to be true and true as time goes

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
by I do find that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Creativity is bound to linear time I've always felt

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that I'm not the first person to say that I

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
mean you know I wrote about it in

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
my book about getting postcards from the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
future where we definitely will talk about those miracles from the future.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
This isn't new agey stuff by the way when we don't like oh I don't like new agey

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
stuff. I don't think it is yeah no I mean I

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
agree with

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
you. More like in the realm of Blake

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
then Marion more.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Good

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to know.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
When we when we spoke briefly before before tonight I asked

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
you to put yourself

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
in

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in a John Coltrane kind of frame of mind trying to.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
To to evoke for me and for us tonight.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Some of your favorite thing.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And among my favorite things that I mean you were

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
going to go through a few of them to set the stage for other things we

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
might talk about I'd like to start by.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
What you consider to be your favorite poem and then immediately told

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
me that's very end for many of us. But let's let's take a listen.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
If we could

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to wait.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I wrote this poem for a student who was thinking about suicide due to a love affair gone run.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It's called

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Wait. Wait for now distrust everything if you

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
have to but trust the hours. Haven't they carried you. Everywhere

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
up to now. Personal events will become interesting

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
again here will become interesting pain will become

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
interesting but that open out of season will become interesting second

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
hand gloves will become lovely again their memories are what give

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
them the need for

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
other hand. And the does the lesson of lovers is the same

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that enormous emptiness carved out of such tiny beings as we

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
are asked

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to be filled. The need for the new love is faithfulness

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to the

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
oh wait. Don't go too early

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
you're tired but everyone's

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
tired but no one is tired enough only wait a little

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and listen to music of hear music of pain music of

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
looms weaving all their loves again. Be there to hear it it will be the

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
only time. Most of all to hear the flute of your

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
whole existence rehearsed by the sorrows play itself into

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
total exhaustion.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Had you ever heard him read it now that's beautiful girl awake you know.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Yeah well we can know.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
What touches you that poem.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Wow the way he circles around to music to. All of the things

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
are musical that aren't music I love that

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and I love him so that he gets to do

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
very mundane things you know hair will be interesting again pain will be interesting but

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
so will hair. The gloves

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
figure.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But also don't I mean given the context in which he wrote this poem.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Yeah we should not solidify the

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
moment right. You know

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
he does want of kindness in that

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
poem. You know to write it for someone who

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
was thinking of suicide

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
compassion and the name

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
of the poem it's just wait just wait

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000
wait.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It reminded me of a.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Of a line of John Virgil ways this poetry can rip in no loss but it defies the

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
space which separates and it does this by its continual labor

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
of

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
reassembling what has been

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
scattered tat smart.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Among among the things that is that among the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
things that you submitted to me as a

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
lift was this if we could watch video

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
number one I'd love you to tell

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
us why she mattered to you I don't know what you are you know

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I

00:10:44.000 --> 00:11:39.000
know you're going to look right there.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.000
That's

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.000
a

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.000
very

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
rare

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.000
film.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
There are scary

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
few performances of hers. That's Eleanor does.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Captured on

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
film and she was known and still is known as the

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
greatest actress of all

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
time. And she

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
was and. Gratian I mean when I was really young when I was in my

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
twenty's I just

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
was printed fascinated by that idea

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
of what made her the greatest actors of all time what did

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
she access. Not that she was acting that way.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What was she accessing. Knows even more than it

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
was how did she get herself out of the way

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
anough to access that thing that made her become the

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
greatest actress of all time and I went to acting school when I was young money. You

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
went to the lay person six months and I found out it was a very important lesson

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I learned I found out I didn't want to be an

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
actor. And. It took me six months. You know I

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
probably knew after three but it

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
was great because I I found out about her and they showed

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.000
a couple of these

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
rare films I was the only one that yeah. This may be the only one

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
but there's another

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
scene you know there's another scene in the really I was on for a while but But what. What

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
did I mean when you see this I'm curious to push you a little bit. What what was it that

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
she access.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I don't know you don't know. Something that

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
is part of a mystery that that's why it's so

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
compelling to undo that mess. You really moves me

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
it. Well it moves

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000
me

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
because she had to suffer to be able to do

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that not the acting she has she has had to suffer

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to get out of the way enough. You know and create a Whelan

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
herself deep enough to be able to do that just is you know that's why

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Shakespeare moves me so much.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Not just that it's the most beautiful language ever written but that

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
the depth of the SOL that kids do I mean his facility with

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
language a spy. But the depth of the fall that could come up with

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
those characters in those stories in the deep understanding. I mean when

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I can't fall asleep at

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
night I I have this. You know how you have

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
a a senior go to that comfort you to help you fall asleep.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I was going to always tell me you don't have an idea. You know what I want you to tell me because you

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
know right now I'm going to work for you this is when I saying OK but lately maybe you can share it.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
What is your well I'm happy to tell you

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
because it won't stop working because it just won't. So I

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
imagine Shakespeare being rowed across the

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Thames from the globe on the South Bank to the master of the

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
rebels'

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
office

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
on the other bank in what's now is lying

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.000
to

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
him and taking his manuscript of Hamlet up

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
to get permission to stage it. I just

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
go over her spokesperson. And then you Paula see.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I think everything makes sense and. He had to

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
get permission to stage Hamlet. OK I you know everything

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.000
makes

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
sense.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So I told you this this Coltrane moment

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I ask.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Roseanne to give me some of her favorite moments

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and she started it and then she simply didn't

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
stop. For the past ten days or two weeks

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I've gotten things I've

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
gotten more and more and more things that she

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
loves I'm afraid I would still leave something out.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Yes And also it just showed an appetite and

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
so will begin with a collage if we could begin with image one and we'll go through

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the twenty nine images.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Fairly quickly.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So that was a collage of the things you love and now if we could go to two.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And you can just comment on them as we go in

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
on site for Monday.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Well. He reminds me of myself as

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
a child for some reason and the good part of childhood and I

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
love that it's roses. So I like a

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
theme.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Let's let's move along with it will make it will make a symphony and

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
then.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Offer explanatory.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
OK let's let's

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
continue

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
our that's an inspiration. A lot of my

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
sewing circle powers that are here tonight. I I'm in a sewing

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
circle and we're all inspired by the woman who created this her name

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
is Natalie Chan and could look at the next

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
image and there is Natalie.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And she's a goddess she has a mission she all of these calls are hand stitched she's put all of

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
these women to work who used to work in the textile industry and were out of jobs and

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
they can take a kid home and they make these beautiful clothes and I

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
wear them on stage that's all I wear and

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
we are all fans of Natalie so we get together in this whole room.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yeah it's

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
a lot of money so many people if they come out all my stuff I want

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
you to know. Well my role is in the brand I don't know why are you going to the whole sewing team

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
if you and

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
but yeah.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
But she she said something to you

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
about we've read well.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I went down there for a workshop in Florence Alabama. So she could teach me to

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
sew John my husband went with me and she

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
was threading my needle and she does this thing where she pulls the

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
threads with first finger tips until the two strands

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
lined up like soldiers. She

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
says. They become smoother as you struck them and John was taking a little I feel.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Video of our hands of her showing me doing this and she said her

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
great accent she says you have to love this thread you have to learn to love the

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
thread not doing your accent very well and she was

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
speaking literally but I heard it as a metaphor.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
When she said it and I was writing a father's not a

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
bird and I just put it right you have to learn to love the

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
thread. And it took a

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
very big meaning for me. So every time I get together.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Sewing group.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Threads with each

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
other and.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Look.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.000
know

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Lawyer

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.000
who

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
day

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
at

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
one

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
point

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
by

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000
one

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
on one I.E.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
no one

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
bought by a little

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
a leg to I Why.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Tell us a little bit

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
about this. That song is about my grandmother

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
my grandparents on my dad's side were cotton farmers

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
tenant farmers in the New Deal in the Works Progress

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Administration colony called Dyess colony in the sunken lands

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
of Arkansas and it's called the sunken lands because the

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
land bank in an earthquake of eight hundred

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
eleven and my parents my grandparents

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
were desperately poor so they were one of the five hundred

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
families who were accepted to live in this

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
colony and it saved their lives and my grandmother.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
just I'm involved with Arkansas State University in restoring that

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
house out of the five hundred thirty left and my dad's boyhood home was one of

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
them and creating a music heritage site and also the new deal you

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
know people don't really pay attention to the New Deal was an

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
enormously important part of our history when socialism worked in this

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
country and save their lives so I just thinking

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
about my grandmother and how incredibly difficult her life

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
was you know she didn't have electricity in the first

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
decade or so. She raised seven

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
children she picked cotton. My grandfather was not a

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
nice man and she suffered silently gave birth at home with an aspirin.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
You know and. I

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
just kept thinking I am a modern woman I live in New York City I

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
have every a minute reacted want to help. But what is it of

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
me that comes from her of there must be something. What is spread

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
what is a threat and I I think it's her tenacity.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
You know she never gave up. I don't give up.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.000
The

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
slums you look at I get a little scared like no no no no oh.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Well you know you just said that you had tenacity DON'T GIVE UP I'M NOT YOUR let's look at a few more

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
images if we could got thrown away my

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
shot. Thank you.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So we we can move to image

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
five.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
That's a painting of Joan of Arc. Which is at the Met. I've gone and

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
looked at that painting a million times you noticed the angel

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
in the trees or.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
It didn't turn out well for

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
her

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
to be bad.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
But she was connected to transform kind

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000
of transcendence right. So it didn't turn out well for her but I think you can be

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
connected to something transcend it and have it turn out well. So she's a

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
cautionary tale but it's beautiful.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
in no particular order you just sent them to me

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
like things. Well you know Delta Blues.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Call connect. Well it's a coconut cake. My

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
daughter had this little cooking show online called Big City grits

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
she lived in Brooklyn but she cooks other of food and.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
It was adapted from my grandmother's recipe and then my one of my oldest friends

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
got involved and so the recipe the three recipes from the three

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
women morphed into one coconut cake and I said that that

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I insist that people eat coconut cake at my

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
funeral.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Somebody please write that down who is younger than me so I'll be here through mine he paused.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So you could write it

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
but you know it's it's said that as a joke but I I

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
think to some extent

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
you.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
It's not that you're thinking about that moment. But some of the experiences you

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
had in

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
the region visiting certain places you

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
were thinking about what it would have felt like say for your mother or your

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
father to be there in the presence of your son to have

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
been present to a

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
moment that they no longer experienced and hear about talking about this

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
cake in some sense you're you're preparing something for the future now in

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
the present that you would like to see happen that you may not witness to know what

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.000
you will

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
know you just made me think of something I have this picture of myself

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
there two years

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
old sitting on the front porch of the house I

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
was born in

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Memphis and there's a very poor neighborhood but the house is still there exactly as it

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
was and I have this picture. Two

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
years old so when the album right before the album came out.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Yes this morning.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Took me down to Memphis to do this thing about the river and the thread my last

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
record and you know tracing the past in Memphis nary thing. So I went to the

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
house set an exact same spot.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Exact same position as I was at two. So I have those two. And I have

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
a third space. So I can go back when

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I'm eighty. And have

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Austria.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So I'm preparing something for the future.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Postcards it.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Samuel Pete.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I have an obsession with Samuel peeps. He you

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
probably know he was the greatest

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
diarist English Tyrus ever and so much of what we know

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
about the seventeenth century in England is because he kept a diary every

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
day he witnessed the Great Fire of London. He was there in the restoration.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
As a boy he thought King

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Charles executed but it's not all of that that's fascinating.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
It's

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
about he cheated on his wife. He's made an

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
arm a promise to himself he's going to give up the wine and going to the theatre but he

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
doesn't he breaks

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
it and he is incredibly honest with himself about his four balls

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
and his strengths and his pride and how much money he's made any gets a new

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
watch and he he described a scene where he keeps taking the watch out of

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
his pocket to look at it and I think well that's what you do when you get a new i Phone You know he

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
does you know some things don't change and there's this one passage.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Where he says just as I wrote this.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
The Crier went by with the lantern and

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
said. It's two am a frosty night. This is just as I

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
wrote this so it's almost like the visceral quality and that

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
is still thrilling press. Yeah. So I signed up for his

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
news e-mail

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
blast

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
and he has thank you once every

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
day I get a diary entry every

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
day by e-mail from Sandy I'm from the same

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
day like and sixteen forty sixteen sixty but for

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
this day so I got you know tonight I'll get April nineteenth.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Sixteen fifty eight.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I know I thought Oh OK my touch and goes deeper than that PA

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
so I went to London to find the church that he belonged

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
to there it is St Olaf

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
and. It's basically the same they boarded up one door

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
from the back. But there's three skulls over the in tree way

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
into the yard and he lived across the

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
street so he would go there and he was. You know a little self-important he was in

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
the Navy office so there was a Pew that was just for the

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Navy officers or not he was an officer he worked in the

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Navy

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
office. Anyway I could go on forever about this I went down on

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
the credibility. It's interesting to me also because of your attachment

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
and reverence for pilgrimage to go I take older men yes

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
P.M.S.. Yeah I definitely do you know I went to the library and having a word and having you up in

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I could tell you I mean this

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
is this is and this is an electrical charge

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
yeah something happens when you're you're in the presence of the. Place and the space.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I mean the sewers empty space you're living in the in the house you

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
because you want to be we he

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
was.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Yeah and has his

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
books. You know he created a beautiful library over time

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
and he willed his library to his nephew and his nephew gave it to Magdalen

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
College in Cambridge because because peeps went to Cambridge.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
So you can go to the Peep's library they recreated it exactly and I went there too.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And I was becoming an unhealthy obsession

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
to

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
another. More recognisable obsession.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Just as much as peeps if not more.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.000

common and she just inspires me so much. Talk

about culture and the way she thinks and paints is very much like Coltrane and

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
her

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Schumer the lovely Myra. And I have you saw

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
the

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
painter a painting that I have is so filled with joy. Right because

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Lloyd the joy and it serves a purpose

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
that joy in

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
that you know which one I have right there in the bounty is table the table laid out

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
with all of the food handouts and yes. I don't know how

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
to do that very well so I look at that to inspire me don't know how to do what

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
well relax into barren tea.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
I know how to

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
work and. Look for inspiration but that kind

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
of bounty is sometimes

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
fields

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
where I don't know maybe I don't have enough gratitude for

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
it it's what you know what you were mentioning in that

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
same passage of T.-Bone Burnett telling you

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
stop worrying but keep

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
working stop worrying keep working. Well I don't do that.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Oh sorry. Oh you know. This is this drug in

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
my ribs work this joy and there's also the other side of

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
joy right confusion.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Right she's a person who goes straight to the obituaries when she's reading the paper and I like to do that too.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I like so do Why yes why do why I mean that's because a bitch worries and not about

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
about the

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
same well except I like to read about plane crashes why what I'm for

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I like

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
to do. Yeah. What will you say well that's

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
a misnomer that was

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
meddling testing go back to that that was this is my favorite

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
interior designer Madeline Castaic she was a French woman she was crazy she

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
would just take broken down chairs and put them in the apartment

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
was some you know fabulous something and her colors were

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
all of green. Black and French blue.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
So you can't really see it there but you can.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So that Mandler and I bonded over Madeline conspiring to

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
we were at dinner with some other women and somehow it got on to design and.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
One of us mentioned Mallika staying and we both like you know who she

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
is because she's not that famous.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
So anyway. That's MY has

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
been tuning my guitar during a

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:50.000
performance. This.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Mariachi

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
for the greatest cheese fallen in the

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
world. You know I have to have three cups

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
in the morning to do you know that TS Eliot drank forty cups of tea a day

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I did not but I do know.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Yeah

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I should

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
call.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
His he just inspires me. He's his sense

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:28.000
of fantasy and beauty.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Did you see the should call show when he was was. At the Jewish Museum two years ago.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I don't believe.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
That's

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Lawrence Olivier with the skull that

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
his performance of Hamlet is I think one of the

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
greatest performances of all time.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
It's

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
you.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
But I don't let's. Let's play if we

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
could hold your number three. I would see.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:46.000
By

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.000
now

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I'm

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
not

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Sally

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
come nigh I am still one

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
a

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
man noname

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
gone

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
and

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:22.000
gone

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
beyond

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
the game

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
listed in the BT

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
news

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
story. Of you speaking to your

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
father and you didn't have the Bible with you.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
And you only had Shakespeare and he said we'll

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
speak tomorrow.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
So in the last few weeks of his life he like it lost a sigh.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And he liked to be read to

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
so they mostly liked the Solve to be read the

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
songs and

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
I would read them when I was down visiting him and I would read in the Psalms and then when

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
I got home he wanted to hear them on the phone so

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I call and read in the Psalms and then I went up to the country forgot to

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
take me to spy Bible and I only had Shakespeare there. So he

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
said let's wait as said dad and so sorry I didn't bring it you know can I read

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
you Shakespeare and he said

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
oh this wait and this song that we just heard is

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
the. I

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
really well that's really my record Black Cadillac which was written

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
after my parents died and my step mother and they

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
all and my stepsister they all died in a two year

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
period and I woke up in the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
night writing that

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
song and I couldn't get the chorus you know I was doing really well

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.000
with the

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
verses and then it was Christmas time my dad died and September was Christmas.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I still hadn't written the courses and I took my kids

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
to St Luke's in the village to the

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Christmas Eve services they went to school at St

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Luke's So if I ever go to church once every five years I

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.000
could have St

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Luke's and they saying that him was

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
were leading still proceeding and I went.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
That's it and I just took those lines and put them in my song. I

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
figured that it was so obvious that I had stolen them that no one

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
would complain and nobody

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
nobody has the right hasn't so much to do you know I always

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
thought that that was not a great vocal because I.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
I hear all my old stuff I start breaking it down into parts you know the sessional

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
who's playing well and not I we had been recording for twelve

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
hours and it was close to midnight when I did that vocal so

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
ever since and I thought I sound tired but you know we

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
kept it but it sounds pretty good.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
You know we're going

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
to thank you. I'm not. Thanks. We're going to skip

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
over some images that just maybe show them in quick succession. If we can show the images in quick

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
succession because I have so many other things I want to talk to you about. But here's some of the

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
other favorite things.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000

and plan on buying a lot of

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
that

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Mark Rylan my favorite actor. I went

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
to London to see

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
him play. Richard the third at the globe. And with my friend Sean

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
tall and at the end I burst into tears. It was so

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
moving and then he brought it to Broadway I went to see it again on

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Broadway is. Amazing

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
experience.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
So starry eyed that was.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I'm really sorry it's sure not that funny to most people but

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
it's I like creating impel playing grabs a hold up in my mind because I fly

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
so much. It's some kind

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
of superstition dead. If

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
I you know if I put it right in front of me it'll never happen.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
That's a terrible picture I didn't know you were going to use

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
that blood diamonds.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
I

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
like medical mystery. I like medical novels and

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
medical memoirs in fact I'm reading the iceberg.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And if you read that Marion quotes about her husband's last two years of his

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
life with a brain

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
tumor. And you know I had

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
a really serious brain condition and had brain surgery and ever since

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
then I just like reading things like that particularly if they figure it

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
out they figure out which for us.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
But you got one before having the brain surgery you really spent a lot of

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
time researching and trying to figure things

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:10.000
out right because I couldn't find a doctor who would tell me what was wrong.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Let's

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
see who is this guy that.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Well you know every songwriter who works in the tradition. I work

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
and owes a debt to Bob Dylan. There would be none of us

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
without Bob Dylan was great to show you some of his

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
material Thank you.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
That is on the headstock of my

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
guitar.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
And I've got a custom Martin guitar they made it for me it's called The Roseanne Cash model not to be

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
to protect it's about it

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
but and it's an O.M. twenty eight which is smaller than

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
a drug not are mine and I asked

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
him to put a rose on the headstock and. They had never done that before

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
but

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
apparently Green had never been on a Martin guitar and it's you know

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
one hundred fifty year history.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
So all of the guitar geeks kind of freaked out when they saw the big screen on the

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
head start. I love that.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.000
That's

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
me

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
coming off stage. I like the moment when it's

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
over with when the OK.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Now doesn't mean I don't love what I'm doing. I like that moment

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
when. I don't know it. And

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
you like the moment before it's

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
my When you metabolize it. Yeah but I like that moment when it metabolizes

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
at the end there's two of my kids.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Some. These are some of your your favorite things now.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Quite firmly you said to me I guess we will have to talk about

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
my

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
father. And.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
I obviously want to talk about the context of your upbringing and

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
you sent me one photo.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Yeah I didn't write this in July. Yeah he sent me one photo and I would like you to tell

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
me everything you possibly see in that

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
photo. It's a remarkable photo.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Number thirty.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Well I was born in Memphis and that's me on my dad's

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
lap when you're you when you're old that was one year old.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And he sent you that photo because

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
it's not about.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Miss It's not about a Miss Right.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.000
It's

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
real this

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000
is just a family photo my dad was taking me to the zoo.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And that was

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
before I mean he made its first

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
record.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
The year before like right around when I was born

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
and but the intense touring hadn't

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
started. He wasn't on drugs.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
My parents were still together. It's not that I have some you

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
know rosy fantasy about how I was in and long for I really

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
don't but

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
that that's important to me because it hasn't been

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
co-opted by the

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
public to that moment. It

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
hasn't been he hasn't yet as you said he has not yet become

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.000
super

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
famous or. You're not yet at

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
that moment in your life are you hearing everybody else. Considering

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
him. God night. Yeah that's well put.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I love that description you have of him coming to a

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
kindergarten class. That's a great story. So my daughter Chelsea was

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
in kindergarten and they wanted grandparents to come in to

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
say what they

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
did.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
What they

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
had. So.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
My dad was came in to Chelsea's kindergarten class and he got up in front of the

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
kindergarten there are a few parents and there are not

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
many. He gave

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
this unbelievable little talk

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
that was the history of American roots

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
music from like that it was in a five year old you know understanding and

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
he just let it through and this mother Lynn told me she cause somebody

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
should film this is unbelievable this you know this should be recorded for

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
history. It's going yeah I mean it was really good really

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
concise and then at the end this kindergartner raised their hand and they

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
said can you duck

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000
walk

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
the greatest part is my dad said Well I believe I can and he

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
touched him. Michael Jackson's across the

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
tour.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
But what I mean is that so many parts of this story which are great and part of them

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
are part of what strikes me so much is that you saw

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
there in your

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
father someone who just knew so much about history.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
He was a musicologist and really had a sense of.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Cred issue and you know I told you that in Hebrew the word for Christian and transmission of

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
the same. Yeah. And he so deeply believed in that that

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
he did he like I said he had the mind of a musicologist and he

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
had categories of songs that he could put you

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
know songs about Appalachian songs about mother. Oh yeah I know forty of those and he could

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
sing them all to songs about dead dogs. Yeah I got those

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
two songs about travel songs about longing for

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
home. And then he gave you. I mean this

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
grand moment he gave you and that's going to ask you to bring it but then I thought

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
maybe better for you to describe it. He gave you this list.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Yeah. When I was eighteen he made a list of songs hundred

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
hundred songs.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
What he called a hundred essential country songs but there really it

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
was broader than country music it was.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
American songs you know there were protests songs and there are history

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
songs and.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
So I saved the list you know I had the good sense to say the list I was eighteen.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I made a record based on the list after he died. Took songs from the list.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
If you had to make a list like

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
that. For your children I

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
am.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
There's some overlap. You know but I grew up in a different generation.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.000
So I would have Beatles and I'd have been the all young and I'd have Dylan.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
But.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
There's the big overlap with my dad Swiss for sure you know.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Hank Williams Long Black Veil all those kinds of songs.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
It's like take a listen to five the engineers dying child which is

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
the engineer's dying child. Why did you pick that one. I don't know.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.000
A

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
little

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.000
bit

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
all the sick bed lay and this was really

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
nice he was the pride and

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
the judge ruled

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
in

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
his duty had called him the love.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
And seeing that hole was

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
there while a tear he shed too is

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
why he said just to lead you astray and

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
I'm just saying a lot when I

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
still hang it where it

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
can be seen if the ME because

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
they then show the red if he's better

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
than the green.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000
He loves that falling. And it's you know there is a tradition

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
in Appalachian music particular singing about into mortality was so

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
high there were a lot of songs about losing babies. So this one is particularly poignant

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
because the engineer has to go to work and he

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
leaves the

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
baby mortally ill. So he tells his wife when the train goes

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
by our

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
house is the baby's dead. Hang the Red Lantern

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
innocent babies that are hanging the Green

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Lantern You don't hear that on top forty radio

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
anymore.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
And that's I think in part what he wanted

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
to impart this love and

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
the songs yeah and I got it.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
I mean you say saying yes. You say traditions can

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
take root out of the dormant impulses of one soul this is at the very end

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
of composer.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
If they are powerful enough for that we acknowledge them or not

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
I finally had the with them and grace.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Not only to acknowledge but to review of them and

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
embody them with the

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
real joy.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
That's so true and it took me a while

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
but. I was in Dublin a few years

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
ago I was walking down the street and there was a beautiful little antique

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000
bookstore and I went in and there was this

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
enormous book on the

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
shelf the sick and it said it was a music book history of

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Irish music so I pulled it down and it fell

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
open to a drawing.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
And said John Cash. In it was a minstrel from

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
the eighteenth forty's and he was carrying a

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
melodeon it's still open to take and it

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.000
was

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
so chilling and then I didn't buy the book because it was four hundred

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
pounds for four hundred euros and you just get four hundred euros come

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
on but never for I took a picture of the page

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
on never ever forget that moment. And it was as if it was

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.000
saying you know you well done last keep doing it.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
He

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000
said he made other lists and I have one that I very

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
much like if you could True Image That's

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:28.000
one. Yeah.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
I kept thinking oh I have something better I have it framed in

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
my my check cave called my chick cave.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
As opposed to a man case. It says

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Tuesday under

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
no circumstances will I talk to anyone in the music or film business

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
today.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
That's good

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
advice.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000
You see he told. You have to be the template of how to be an artist.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
They are the father you write provided a template for me of how to live

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
with integrity as an artist today.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
He taught me to respect my

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
audience and a lot of the integrity isn't in that as a

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
performer. You know I said never

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
forget which town

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.000
you're in never forget that people have used their heart and their own dollars to

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
buy a ticket to come see you.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
You know show up on

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
time show up when you're performing really show up be

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
there be there.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Yeah out so that has its own integrity and

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
then ruthlessness as a

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
writer you know that's a separate integrity.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
You say in

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
your eulogy you described him as a Baptist was so.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Of a mistake.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
So I love God with the means.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:06.000
He didn't

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
judge and even though he was deeply spiritual It

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
just didn't fit into he said it was a Baptist but I didn't see that as fit into that you

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:25.000
know has he had too big of a consciousness about spirituality.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Let's take a listen to what you six are winding

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
stream me. Now.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
To me singing streams

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
not

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000
to needing

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
to leave to stream.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Yeah

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
this

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.000
i

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000
first

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
thing this when he was dying this is the

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
last song I said to you two things. I couldn't.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
That's a Carter Family

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
song and those were the first songs I learned on

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
guitar the Carter family was on the road with my dad and

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
their hours in the dressing room backstage and so the women

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
June Helena needed Maybelle Carter. They taught me all the

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000
songs and that's really where my love began for

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
these Auld. Roots in traditional songs and he liked to hear me sing

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
that when I see much of his wife I say

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
no and a few

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
others but that

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
was you know he was gone after I sang that

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000
song. Singing together for example when it comes

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:59.000
to number seven.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.000
There's

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
a

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:15.000
little

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000
full

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
chat

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.000
on

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
playing

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
the

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
evening

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:35.000
first

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:43.000
thing.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Many

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:57.000
of

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.000
us

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
left

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.000
so

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.000
told

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
him to. The

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
hard way.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Roseanne just said that she had something to play for us.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Because I said I had something to say but all the

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
way into this room. Thank

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
you thank you

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
where things can happen. Well I don't want to play that song I just nodded but no

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
idea where I was going to

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
say that. That

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
that was recorded not too long before my dad died.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And I took to get down to Nashville so he could record.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
His part I recorded my part and.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
He was not feeling well at all and like I didn't know that morning in fact that he was going to be

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
able to do it but he said he read the lyrics and he said I can I can do this you know we went over to the

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
studio and he sang it I could see him getting in a G. as he started

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:19.000
singing you

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
know and he said. Now you take that back to New York

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and if it's not good enough that John doesn't think it's good enough I'll do it

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
again said dad. It's so good

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and I was so sweet. There's even in that moment.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You know has this integrity.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
You know he goes he says about you in his autobiography said

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Roseanne and I operate on much the same wavelength. So there's always been a

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
special closeness between us.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It's not a matter of deeper love or good than between me and the girls

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
it's about like a greater degree of instinctive

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
understanding. I would say that's true.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Let's play something that's never been played before you might want to set that up a little

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
bit you you you let New York know today that Jerry would they

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
would be hearing something out of the vaults that has

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
never I wonder I was wondering if you and I were mad about

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
that now. Oh good OK well I wasn't mad at all I would have

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
been upset if I hadn't gotten to it.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.000
When

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I was recovering from brain surgery it was a long recovery and I was not

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
feeling well and. I laid on the

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
couch for a long time like a year and I was just one

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
day laying there and I just saw this image of me and

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Elvis Costello and Kris Kristofferson together doing

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
something recording something image number thirty two friends and they're

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
both close friends and that I had never thought about the three of us at the.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And any sense to me but I anyway I emailed Elvis I said do you want to riot

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
and song together and then John in the

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
background. And if Chris wants to join shall we do this song together

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and he goes yeah.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So I A Chris doesn't do email but I emailed Lisa and they were his

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:19.000
wife

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
and they were both into it.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So we looked at our calendars and it turned out that April

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
first

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
two thousand and eight was the only day. Within a two year period that the three

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
of us would be in New York City at the same time you wrote the song the song

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
A profits which you're not going to play now that it's on

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Elvis's the CD that just came out with his memoir. So we got to

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
the studio. I had written a verse Elvis had written a burst nothing from Chris we

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
were so worried we get to the studio. Chris writes his verse we record the

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
song that day.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
It's beautiful. We couldn't think what to call it so we called it a process. So it had never come

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
out but. Elvis just put it out with his memoir with the CD and we were so happy.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So same

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
day we wrote another song I had started

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
it

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
and send it to all the same thing. Chris shows up slow.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
We've also finished the song that day recorded it and it's been in

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
the vaults and two thousand and eight. It's never come out but Alpha's email me just a few days

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.000
ago and he said what are we going to do about the song. Some people should hear eight gods

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
of Harlem and now they will.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah first go let's

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:47.000
go

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
next. Banking hall

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:31.000
The

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:59.000
beyond bomb.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
A guy had to push

place and a place down

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
a good feeling in the hind limbs am

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
using

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
P.S. the best chance missed the renminbi

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
myth a news you need in

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
your room to slowly indeed limp old

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
a limited old Polonia great disdain

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
bomb been made against the

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:37.000
am

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
thankful we are slowly wind

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
down this question comes to

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000
to me for you from Elvis Costello.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
So I asked him yesterday and he does do email thankfully said

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I suppose I'm beginning with the statement. Rather than a question but. I think

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
the list contains some of your most beautiful

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
singing and this seem to add another dimension to your vocals on

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
the river in this thread. Given that singing other people's song

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
is usually where we

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
begin. I'm curious to know. Ruth if

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
contemplating any one song on the list also opened

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
up some new musical or lyrical possibilities within

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
your songwriting.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Well

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
in general the standard of songwriting is so high on the list

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
that it's it motivating in a challenge and you know it's something

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
to to reach for and to try

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
to you know pop up your game to I'm never going to

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
write I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry that's written but it's

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
it's inspiring.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Singing long black veil. I think that

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
that's. It's such plain language and

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
it's so it's full of ghosts and it's a very dark story

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
that I would say is some songs on the river in the

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000
thread are cousins to long but they're all in that way cousins. Yeah.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
You know I I feel

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
that you're. There's a lot

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
of songs are complete somewhere else

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
and that you can pull them down

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
sometimes in there depending on your level

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
of skill and how hard you work to just been

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
disappointing yourself and refining your skills you can pull down better songs you know

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I want

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
to I'm never going to get Bob Dylan songs or drill. I want to indicate I want to and.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I want to end with this image thirty three we could.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
is a song always presses me brings back such sad memories. You know what I

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
mean I've never heard another song that depresses me the way this one

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
does play it again will you and I asked

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
you

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
tonight to end our

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
evening on a moment of joy and I remember

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
you has been saying that's a deal breaker.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Yet we always hear we don't do Joy.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Actually after most of our songs you know people

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
want to sort of put an end

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
to their lives and you. You said you might try.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Well I had to call my manager and say Do I have any songs that even

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
slightly resemble Joe

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I so let's see

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:32.000
now during.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
The Well. Should I Do you

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
know. Anything you guys want to hear

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:47.000
in particular.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Seven

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Year A is that you think

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
projectable

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
some are echoing you know.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Now. OK wait here's some.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Think river in the

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
thread and it's got a course that you could sing along to actually and

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
so you'll know where that it falls so I'd prefer it if you

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
would the line that you'll sing along to is.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Fifty thousand watts of Common Prayer and that comes

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
from there's a radio station in Memphis called W D I A and

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
their slogan is fifty thousand

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
watts of goodwill. And I loved

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
that but I thought you know if you've been changed by something you've heard on the radio there are a lot of

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
us who've wives have been changed by something we heard on the radio and so

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
we're a community and that's a common prayer and this is called fifty

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
thousand watts

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
of common

01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:04.000
for

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
the mud from budget to

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Sheila's

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.000
shoot

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
still closed the

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000
deal

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:38.000
yet the thing is broken and painted in smooth.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
There's a lot old

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
