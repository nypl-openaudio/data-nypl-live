00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Good

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
evening

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
evening evening my name

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is Paul Holden grave I'm the director of public programs here at the New York Public Library known

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
as LIVE FROM the New York Public Library as all of you know my goal at the library is to make

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the Lion's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Roar to make a heavy institution downs and when successful to

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
make it levitate.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It is a pleasure to welcome Mary Louise Parker she was here. To welcome her back she was

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
here was Ryan Adams some years back and Mary Karr for the first but I

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
hope not the last time to be live from the New York Public Library after the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
event which would last about as long as a psychoanalytical session if your shrink is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
generous they will they

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
will both sign their books.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Upcoming two more events next week I will be interviewing Edmund a

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
while you may remember he wrote a magnificent

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
book called The here with amber eyes and now he's written a book

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
about the mysteries of whiteness in the form of porcelain.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Then in December the Robert Silver's lecture will be delivered this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
year by Helen Vendler.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I would like to say a big thank you to the Ford Foundation for their fantastic

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
support of life from the New York Public Library ten Senate verse

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
three to celebrate the Ford Foundation will match your contribution to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
alive dollar for dollar. When you give you will help. Make sure we

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
can continue to engage New Yorkers in conversations that contribute

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to and enrich the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
cultural discourse. Please consider giving with a pledge you will

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
find on your way out. Additionally I want to thank

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the continuing generosity of Celeste barters and mend and Adam bottoms.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Essayist Mary Karr knows about writing a life. New book The Art

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of memoir is an elegant exploration of one of today's most

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
popular literary form. Tonight. She's joined by actress Mary

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Louise Parker because I'm conventional memoir in letters.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Dear Mr you was described by car as tense piecing

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
really funny and a magnificent necessary

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
surprise for reflection on the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
show as many of you know for the last seven or eight years I've asked my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
guests to provide me with a biography of themselves in seven

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
words seven words that may or may not describe them a haiku of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
sorts so if you're very modern a tweet. Mary Louise

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Parker submitted the seven words to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
me I'm not dead yet.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Don't make

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Mary Karr submitted the seven words to me best

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
selling memoir wrist award winning

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
poet black belt sinner.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
He's welcomed

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
them or

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:46.000
if.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.000
There

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
are

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.000
actual

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
humans out there. Now I have to bury Louise

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to begin by. By reading that section.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Well there are so many sections. The book she could have started with this is Dear Dr I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
hope is that right. Towards the end this is the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.000
end

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of the letter to the doctor that say

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
he may be sitting next to you I have no.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
got to watch people trying to save a life.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I felt mine pulled away and back in spurts of protest and

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
compliance from a completely different vantage point. I got to measure a length of

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
mortality against that infinite question mark best of all there is a

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
small

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but distinct category of negative thought that I abandoned somewhere when I realized I only had

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the strength to hold so much and something had to go. I can't

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
decide where existence lies or verily

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
dangles and Dr maybe you don't know either but I can tell you I am humbled by the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
second chance. I don't know what death is but I'm one hundred percent clear on what it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
isn't it isn't

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
my daughter refusing to try on a pair of shoes while the salesman admonished me for buying her the wrong

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
in souls and then leaving the store furious. As my daughter says I want you to know

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I support you one hundred

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
percent. And today be the day I start drinking coffee and

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
also isn't the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
dog digging a pack of gum out of my purse and chewing it then paying on the gum wrappers and crawling in

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
my lap making me forget to hate her. It isn't having the door handle to my office break

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
off in my hand when I realize my only keys are in there and then remembering that. Oh

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
yeah these are luxurious problems.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
It isn't having too much to do and wanting to scream and it isn't screaming.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It might be poetry but it isn't sitting and hearing it read by my son. It isn't

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
him giving a standing ovation for the actor with the smallest part or my daughter confessing

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that she lied and then doing a cartwheel it isn't getting

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
a whole email in the E.S.L. from my niece and not caring that it's been. Literally incorrect

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
because I laughed so hard while reading it that I actually cried tears.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It is an Antiques Road Show after sex for the sixth time while the sheets threaten

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to disintegrate.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It isn't me listening to my children breathe at night and that being enough to want to keep

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
my heart pumping

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
blood that one. Mine was not the only heart you

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
saved Sure they might have used their last of their mother to fuel them

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in life toward a greater purpose or maybe it would have been so damaging

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that they'd never fully come back.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Thanks to you I don't have to watch either of those scenarios play out while perched on a

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
cloud fighting with God to let me intercede or spend eternity aching

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to at least become the quivering sunbeam that lands on them one morning when they roll out of

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
bed age twenty

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
five

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
as my friend Father Bob says medicine can be more art than science.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I believe the best doctors are a particular category

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of artist with the creator's instinct to throw something on a canvas

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and start expanding which must come down to divinity and the ability to judge

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
what would bleed well into

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
what it was too scary for me to face my

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
body giving me warnings of being so screamingly temporary. I wonder

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
how often we are being nudged But we turn away. We find a place to jettison

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.000
all of

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
it or hand it to someone and say here. Please organize this for me

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I can't stand it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It would be eeriest those warnings lingered somewhere the sound of

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
them run

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
home. Don't answer the door or walk away from Him

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Now what if that lasted.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
If only I knew what last meant there is no now.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
My father would say banging his cane on the floor on the word now as soon

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
as you say the word it's. Already in the past when is it. There isn't one.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is the only moment and it has already passed the only thing says

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.000
spending

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
time are children and cross-country travel not even all our stars

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
are moving that was light years ago. It's only us here dying as slowly

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as we can.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Lose

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.000
if

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
you're another section we're going to read.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Now as for you and I are going to read. I guess later harder than

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
when everybody's bored. OK. This will save it will save it and say I'm

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
going lighter. Like all the death actually were done now.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That was it that was the whole

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
event

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
you know your book store I read your book today. It's like the fourth time I read

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
this and I didn't intend to reread it I intended to skim it

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and what people don't know about Mary Louise is she reads a lot of poetry so there's a lot

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of poetry in the

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
book but it starts with gratitude.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
To you who can fix my screen door. My attitude

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and open most jars to you who

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
codified slams a park built a decent cabinet or the

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
perfect sandwich use or you took my order my

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
pole my

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
bullshit.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Were you a daddy's

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
girl. I still am daddy's

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
girl why it's never did I think that that's a terminal condition and I bet

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that one doesn't stop you don't die from it that well.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Played

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
out by it. I think it's funny that you.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Mentioned poetry

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
in gratitude and the same sentence like that because I

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
was I was really reading your book Devil's Tower

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and I was struck by the way you

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
said poetry never left you stranded and I

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
feel that's what I always got from poetry is feeling like you know if

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
you're someone who grew up and

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.000
people

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
tend to roll your eyes if you're an actress and you say that you're a loner but you just have to take my

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
word for it or you can talk to whoever wants my high school

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
but. If you grew up and all were someone who ever felt

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
lonely or isolated or you know separate

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
there is something about the distilled experience and in the spray of words like on the

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
page that just for me made me feel

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
less alone in a way

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that that movies didn't or are or

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
are not even necessarily fiction.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Sometimes but you read poetry am I wrong almost exclusively like you read

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
more poetry than script I read more nonfiction or not to read too

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
many scripts Yeah but I read poetry.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Mostly

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I do read other things I love short stories I love and know Briain and

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
deadly EISENBERG And that's what I do read an awful lot of poetry Yeah.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Why do you think every This this book for those of you haven't read it it's

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
a kind of love poem to the masculine involving fathers

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
grandfathers

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
sons daughters of people a guy

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
named Tarzan who wears a loincloth and I don't think you actually dated there

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
were something going on there.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Why is everybody so mad at

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Boyce Thank you I mean actually we know why they're mad at boy. Why

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
don't they buy out your baby Here's

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
one now show us your stuff.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I feel like if I were to get a write a book

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
about the masculine and men I mean

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
who in the end who love

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
men more than me and maybe that's we can go to the mat

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
about that later

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but yeah I do love men and I and I

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
was raised by this extraordinary man and I was lucky enough to meet these

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
men throughout my life who with little maybe what might be forgotten gestures

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
or even relationships or moments that loomed kind of

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
ironic for me in my life.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You know the boy that I didn't really I didn't know his

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
name and that I saw in the hospital

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
or there's your legacy like your big

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
C. big feet. I do have

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
an appreciation for what is

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
male despite being almost again

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
terminally female myself in many ways almost tragically so

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
but there I do love men and I

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
have spent a good deal of my life trying to figure out why I

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
was forfeiting

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
parts of myself in exchange for that a certain kind of attention from

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
them or.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Give me a print or printed I think Santa love that God Well I happen to have

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
a several hundred of those are. Available to you for a pittance. I

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
think I

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
think my friend I think this is the book.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Joe when he first saw me in college used to call me the girl without a spine because I

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
was always draped on some

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
guy you know and I think it came from being such a

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
wallflower that once I was out of my cage and I found that I figured out how

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that one worked. I wanted to play with that toy

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
all the time I

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
didn't want to let go of it and I wanted this one and that it was just sort of an

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
insatiable they that wasn't always entirely

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
only sexual or romantic either.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
You know and suddenly when I was at college I suddenly had all these game male friends that I never had in high

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
school in Arizona nobody was out of the closet when I was a high school. Suddenly they wanted to borrow

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
my pantyhose and do their makeup and I was like I was in heaven I was like a whole different

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
side. Of men that I didn't

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
know which is also reflected in the book.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
She Mary Louise has at the at one point very early in the book one of my

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
favorite hitchhiking song signs of all time. Marin

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
County please. We've read

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
start you know it work

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
let's that's a really critical area because when you're just outside of Berkeley.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
That's how you have picked up it works really fast and I don't like the meeting so you had to hide

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
the boys. They met and they pushed me out on

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
the corner by the off ramp and made me pull my skirt up which was already. You know.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Yeah out in Philly High and pulled my shirt off my shoulder

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and get us a ride and as soon as somebody stopped they would

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
pile in the back which you should not do now ever hitchhiking is not

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
safe now even in Berkeley.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But wasn't safe then I mean Ted Bundy was cruising looking for you.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Yeah I didn't know about that. They didn't tell me that who did.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Yeah we did it on a guy doing a cheesy. Right. Well you know

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
hitchhiking it's a slippery slope. Let's just leave

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
the.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Girls got to get from one side of the bridge to the other you know. Do you know what to talk about to your blue I'm sorry I

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
love him you know I know you don't gripe to them how he what he wore because it's

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
an in. Trysting Well you know I don't try all he could read that your way. Now because

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
it's better than my saying it when I

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
was very young

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I worked in a health

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
food sort of co-op. It's kind of a legendary

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
place and you're it's

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
not called per se but there were

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
cultish aspects to it and it was at a time when there were no begins there was

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
no people didn't put chia seeds in their front but you know things like that it

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
was really a way different time and spear Lino was something exotic

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
anyway and I was living near the beach

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and I never wear shoes and that was like one

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
particular chapter and I met this guy whose name was blue. This

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
is the letter I write to him Dear Lou.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Did you sell it. I'm just trying to imagine where you got

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
it there was no such thing as Amazon yet and I'd never seen one except on

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Tarzan your loincloth But did you use fabric from an old

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
couch but didn't have a couch. Maybe you liberated a square of fabric from your

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
teepee or stitched together some burlap bags that once held a hydroponic

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
fertiliser you wore that cloth on your loins every day so maybe there was even

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.000
a

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
spare when you were a fruitarian eating nothing but fruit and nuts.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Though apparently beer was the fruit of a van illegally parked on

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the beach not beside it on it was your home and you needed no shirt shoes

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
nothing you and your friend Gary drove to the border at dawn to get avocados and

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
fix for the co-op where I worked also and then you went to the beach if you had no one to Rolf you were

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
all for massaging those lucky people while wearing nothing or your

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
loincloth OK maybe a piece of jewelry was also on your

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
body a necklace but that was it you and Gary both had

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
gorgeous ocean so care that was longer than. Mine. Gary had a mane of

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
chestnut that might have made him rich if you don't been

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
to seven stations of the cross theme park your hair was its

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
own Disneyland it glowed in the dark from salt water and sun that hair gave

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
you the vibe of being both switched on and overcooked at the same time.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
You were the only man I've ever seen who could wear your hair in a bun with a flower and not

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
seem sissy. You had sold patches and

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Tans period. Diving in the surf might happen five times a day and how could you lie down at

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
the tide and feel sand rushing everywhere if you were wearing clothes when you took me to

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
that nude beach up the coast taking off your loin cloth seemed brazen a

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
dog could walk away with your entire

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
wardrobe.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Ripping it off was a breeze though and you threw yourself into the water leaving me an op how little there

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
was between you in the world. It took hardly anything to be not just happy but filled with

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
a kind of alien joy.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
You took anyone's idea of modern life and set it on fire decades

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
before anyone dreamed up burning man. You didn't need

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
to rent an R.V. with wife I and stuck up at Whole Foods to drive somewhere and let the madman and your

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
third eye. You've found it had it and let it in and had it going on and out again.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Even your name which you said had become you after you dropped acid and were sitting on

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
a massive rock by the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
cliffs when you opened your eyes everything including you was blue

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
except your loin cloth which for the summer I knew you was a light brown man wrap that

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
made you and Gary look

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
like Malibu Jesus dolls. And kept you from being arrested for indecent exposure by

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
more or less covering your genitalia you and Gary would come into the co-op first thing in

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
the morning

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
with many report and pouring out of your van the two of you with pelt me with flowers while I sat in

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
the back of the stock room bagging and weighing organic knots and bizarre dried

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
sea vegetables. Back then only the hardcore who came into our store even knew

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
about dried

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
kelp in the eighties. Only true

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
hippies bought sparely in a bag and snorted it or however they took it one side bag

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and labeled it probably incorrectly and priced it most definitely incorrectly.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Somedays joining me at the scale was a sweet and sellin transgender boy named

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Lux who wasn't much better than I was we got in trouble for throwing a block of gouda up

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
at the ceiling fan to see if it would come down in chunks. They separated us.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
They had one of

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
us bag while the other stuck dairy which meant standing in the refrigerator and replenishing all the yogurt

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
and Kieffer and freezing our asses off. I found the scale confusing and was never good

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
at math.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So I'd spend hours getting yelled at by that girl named Jackie who was a higher up. I heard

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
you used to date her which I had a hard time picturing Jackie dressed in

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
those macrame tops that she made in tie

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
dyed and she sewed her own maxi pads with inspiring words in Don and be

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
used to make her connect to her

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Yoni I don't know if you were into this also but janky drank her pee

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
which once she blew in my face lightly. Then ask me Hey does my breath smell like

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
urine was brave in a way but she was hard to admire because she had Mohnish me daily

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
for being an app.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
She said my mistakes made her feel confused and out of touch freshly

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
punished I go back to my station

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
and try to get the plankton or ground Macia out from under my nails wishing I didn't have to work two

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
jobs or that one of them didn't have to be this

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
one which sometimes paid me and

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
avocados.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
That Lucy was

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
really kind

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
of a beautiful guy and I say that in the true hippie sense

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
the she was switched on he

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
had actually emanated some kind

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
of light and I remember before I went into work my first day somebody said

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
to me

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
see if you meet this guy blue I want to hear what you think about him.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And I just remember turn around and this guy was like it was as though he had his own light source

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.000
behind him sort

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
of all he read was a

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
halo he was beautiful and he was beautiful inside

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
and out he

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
really did you I didn't understand your relationship is that somebody you actually

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
went out with I wouldn't say we

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
went out the door but I didn't. There was no there was not a

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
lot of out. Not about to go to there were you were

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
out is the town was outdoors he.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I'm trying to obscure his identity

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
but I wouldn't say we went out. But that we had an appreciation

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
for one another that.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Dear papa you said you would love me till you were ashes. But there we

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
see him poor guy has told us to I know he does this how could he not. I know how you feel.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
You'll have to fight me. But they're not all they're not all glorious

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
these men you come across there

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
is is that Sara boasters river a Serb or

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
us the dog that guards the gates of hell the three headed

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
dog you dated him. All three of him.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Many had to

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
arrive. Can you explain how you landed on Sir sir sir Bruce for

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
him for this dude why I love

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
to have to kind of explain

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
why I use that method for telling

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that story but really it was just kind of a cool all right like a fairy tale and then I can use

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
a different font at the

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
beginning

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
but it was in the end what made it work for me was

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
that I wanted I needed to waited to recount these relationships because they were

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
a huge part of my life and some of them were punitive and dead and ugly.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And I thought it would be effective to tell it in a way where you know when

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
you remember. Things. Everything becomes completely polarized and you're completely

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
innocent and the story and the other person is

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
demonic and this I wanted to say it as well I

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.000
wanted I

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
wanted to sort of almost do a cartoon version of that and I thought it would.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Then it would give the story levity. Because what I didn't want to do

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
was seem like I was asking for sympathy or elicit any kind

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
of you know because I was complicit in that I laid down for it

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
I asked for it I I conjured it I even pulled it out of people I think at

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
times and it's also a conversation that I still have with myself that I don't fully

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
understand I think if you had more than one relationship that

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
wasn't ideal rock to tell you

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
know mostly so many

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
beautiful relationships but I have had a handful you know I'm fifty one years old

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
that were not awesome and you do end up having that conversation with yourself

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
over time why did I do that why don't love that it's like my mother

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
was married seven times I always thought that once you have figured it out

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
or will know at what point do you

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
say maybe it's not them.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Right.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Is it number three number four. Now it's like you're picking

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
them lady like is what I was saying throughout that is like this is essentially the

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
same man just sprouting a new head that since there was nothing for them but a kind of

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.000
pants

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
that you know to me that's one of the most

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I'm in some ways moving it in

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
realistic portraits I mean there are there ARE

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
NOT do you think you're too hard on yourself. I mean I often thought I think so

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
yeah I mean as I was reading those even

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
despite naming somebody after three headed dog guards the gates of hell.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
You to you seemed to me like your berry. If there was an asshole in the

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
book it's often you. Yeah. Yeah my role in my wrong well I'm not going to write a book where

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
I'm indicting other people and if I'm going to if there are needs to be a foil I can use I have plenty of

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
material to use myself for you

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
know. I didn't but it's such a funny book it's such

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
a funny book I didn't want this book to be in any

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
way I feel like we're in a culture of it seems to be there's a

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
new witch hunt every day you know there's like everyone's exposing something or

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
someone and there's you know

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
tends to Lebanese who have three nipples or something like that or click here a few

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
you know. Horrible pictures of people at the grocery store it just I

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
feel there's enough exposure in a damning way that

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
why

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
not there are so many instances in my life that I'm so

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
grateful for someone who shine a light on me for one moment

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
or showed me some kind of kindness like a my accountant or the

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
doctor my friend Adam or so many people my friend

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Jeff can I just feel that I just read the introduction a dear A I

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
just have love for these people. I wanted to write something that was nice

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
there Abraham you took me in when I scratched at your door needing somebody with your

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
skill set. How you feel about your account and I just met a bi want

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
him to be my account now he did he

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
did

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
treated me and still treats me like you saw like a daughter he treats me with

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
such love and care

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
and who can say that about their

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
accounts because so far for me and it it's not even when he met me I

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.000
was

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
this girl.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I was completely broke he had to tell me I was broke because I didn't know I couldn't understand my

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
bank statements and he had to explain them to me and break the news to me the unfortunate news that

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I had

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
absolutely no money. Because I'd spent it all I had bought I'd just gotten

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.000
a little bit

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
of money and used. A credit card and so other

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
funds and gotten a pool table for a boy and he had to tell me you could

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
not afford that pool table

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
and I became very depressed and I thought I could sleep on his

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
couch and I took a nap on his couch and he just kind of sat there and stared at me for a couple of hours

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
and it's not like I was somebody that he was impressed with or that I was just a

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
girl in his office or just wandered in you know who really did

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
need guidance and who needed his help and he gave it to me for no other reason that

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
he was kind and

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
he felt a connection to me you think people are phrase it was Q U R Q

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That is cute now but I was cute then I think you're way huger than you were.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I think your cuteness quotient is rising. My personal opinion.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Do you think people are afraid to say they need something. Do you think now I mean we're talking

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
about talking about the kind of outrage culture one of the things I was moved

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
to that moved me about these pages. And I had

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
a sort of I had to interview or somebody

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
said. You know when you have

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
celebrity books in the back of your book suggesting that people read them and this

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
is somebody I mean you can tell by the prose this is not.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
This is not look at my titties at the afterparty kind of prose

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
I mean it was years ago. Yeah. It was years ago for all of us.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Yeah. But do you think people to me what I look part of what

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
I loved about the book was his sense of true not afraid to say what you need you're

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
not afraid to go to sleep on Abraham's count. I would be

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
terrified. Honestly I felt most of my life afraid to say to

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.000
ask for

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
things. And I often

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
felt more of an observer which is why I think I have a fairly keen memory

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
for details of of moments that I observe. Didn't other people or expressions or things that

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I saw wash over people's faces

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
or things that they said those kind of things I remember.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
So so acutely and it's from being the person who was

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
watching and I never

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
felt brave enough

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
to ask for things and I still don't. And it's funny because I remember

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
that moment with him and I barely remember. Can I sleep on your couch but he remembers and.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
I remember that he asked me if I wanted something to eat and I was starving and I said

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
no I wasn't starving

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
but I was really hungry and I said no this is not what

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
we do that these women you're not supposed to eat too much. Well you know just because of someone says Would you like

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
this can I get you something to drink. So let's I can let's start saying yes from now on for anything.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Almost everybody here if we all pinky swear

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
we set out tomorrow with that as a goal and we've got a shot.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
But you do seem to remember very keenly. And I'm often accused of making things

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
up when I

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
say I remember so do you think why do you do you think you have a particularly

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
physical memory because the book seems to me to have a lot

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
of physical details and I think I over invest in other people and I over

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
connect to other people and that's why

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
my relationships are so intense sometimes because it's got that release that you get when you

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
feel seen suddenly you know which is at war with. The

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
majority of Me What's hates to be looked

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
at you know I do I do crave being you know you want to be

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
really seen by someone and connecting to somebody is paying

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
attention to them and what do they need

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
and what are they thinking and what do they want for Christmas and and oh I just saw

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
them touch that tire went out you know those kind of things I

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
remember. And it's over connecting that which makes me disconnect from other things

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.000
which

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
makes me leave the mail in the freezer. You know that makes

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
me forget huge chunks of the day. Or it's.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
It's and it's not that I'm saying I'm so martyred or I'm so saintly that I'm over connected I'm not sure that

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
that's necessarily a good trait. Sometimes it is and sometimes it comes out

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
of a generosity and sometimes it comes out of me

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
need you know and it's hard to say which is which I mean I'm not

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
really probably self-aware enough to say which one

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
is acting at which

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
point you know when when you're being generous we want to believe that all our

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
generous gestures come

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
from goodness but sometimes they come out of need. I

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
think need to feel like a good person but it feels like if it isn't at all that

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
So isn't it also need to be

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
there and need to connect to someone in need to be

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
needed feel less lonely. I mean that's not feel less lonely to cheer being only

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
don't like meeting those shoes but then use I know they're so good but then you.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
She told me sequins were in general they are the same No they

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
are bad show is for and you heard it here on ISSUES

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Mary said Yeah she said she looked

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
at him she said Booker

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
please. Yeah I respect that.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I do I do feel like if

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
you if you are aware of when

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
when you're acting out of need then then you can be aware when you have a

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
truly generous gesture when you are being completely selfless when you really

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
know when that is that that there's a difference between the two does that make any

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
sense. I've seen you with your kids and you're an incredibly generous mother

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
get two beautiful beautiful children a son and daughter you got one of

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
each I only have one but I'm sprouting another.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Recruit it. I recruited a daughter through my son. But what

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
are you. What kind of mother are you it's not even a pure question to ask or

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
you it. I mean it

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
seems to me just as your. Friend or someone who seeing you with your kids you

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
seem me didn't you have like the whole why Young Thing night or something I mean was in that.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
We

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
have around the

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
world nights where it's do we do like we do Evening

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
in Paris and we'd played Piaf and make you know French

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
food and then we dress. You know where the red robe or re

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
you speak French and we did evening in Japan. We did evening in the middle ages and we all

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
ate drumsticks have a go sounds of some things I thought yeah

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
it does things like game nights we'd have a way that doesn't seem

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
like that kind of household but I mean who really thinks of that we've

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
been Was your mother that kind of mother was your father that kind of

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
father couldn't couldn't be that kind of money and she had four children should not have anyone helping her at

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
all and you know there's times when my dad didn't have a

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
job and you know my dad was looking for work or he was at work and she was just

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
trying to get food on the table and get us taken care

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
of and I mean to be

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
a single mother is a different kind of pressure but. I have

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
had the luxury at times because my job allows me when I do

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
work I work very intensive hours but then I have times when I'm off and I can

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
take them to school every single morning and I can be the one that puts them to bed

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
at night and if I can be I will

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
be and it's much more interesting to me than going

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
out and going anywhere. It's just it's much more fulfilling

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
for me it fortifies me and in the way I I wanted my whole life. You know I wanted

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
that as did you how do you feel about I know your son is interested in

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
acting your daughter no she's she

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
us. She's very artistic very artistic she's an incredible

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
visual artist she's a she's a beautiful singing voice.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
She plays beautiful piano and she. I think she does have a bit of a clown about her as well

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
so but you know you don't really know

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
my son is a great writer

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
and perhaps unfortunately seems to

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
be a bit of an actor.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
But you wouldn't discourage them as long as one of the largest anything because I think I really

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
got that from my father

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
who he felt like it was not his place to give advice

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
and even when I went to college I went to drama school and you could

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
take minimal

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
minimal academics classes

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
and get a B.A. and I said I think those are going to interfere with my arts class and my dad

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.000
said

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
OK. And he said I think now my kids came to me and said basically I'm going to go

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
to college for four years but I'm not going to have a

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
B.A. what would I say. And because of my father I would say OK you know what you're

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
doing because that's what he said to me I said I'm going to be an actress. So I

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
don't need to go study Gian. I have like one geometry class once a week which

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
I'm going to fail anyway. You know if

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
you're your movement teacher was not as encouraging to you that there's a

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.000
chapter here called Fear movement teacher what was your failure in movement class you seem to be able to walk talk.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.000
What

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
was it that he wanted to let you explain really what he wanted you to do it was unclear at

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
the beginning to be. He really took

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
a dislike to

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
me and I ever learned over the course of my life that

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
I have it's can sense

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
tough give off some kind of vibe that is strong. When I come

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
into Rome I suppose he didn't like me and but at this point

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
in my life I wasn't paranoid and he really didn't like me at this point in your life you were wearing opera gloves

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
to breakfast here and.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
And I felt sort of per. Secured

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
it by that and he wrote an evaluation

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
that sort of detailed what I wasn't doing in the

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
class and. What I was doing that was not acceptable like lack of physical

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
energy is alarming it appears doubt and

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
board asks offensive questions. What's an

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
example actuality is offensive. But

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
he wrote this evaluation and put me on Art's probation and at first I felt

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
our probation.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
We're going to take your arts away from you but he I felt super persecuted and then a

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
friend of mine said to me What are you going to do about

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
that and it was one of those moments in my

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
life where I was just able to hear the truth and at first

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I was kind of slapped I felt really stung and

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I would I mean what am I going to do he hates me and you know you expect your friends to

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
say yeah these are evil and.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And he said no he's a teacher and suddenly I was struck by

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
the fact there's. This the truth in that

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
was intractable it was just irrefutable. He's the teacher and I'm the stupid There's nothing I could say back

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
and I realized and it was invigorating that moment it was

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
a slap in the face but it really inspired me and I thought he doesn't like me

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
and it didn't happen in that moment but it happened.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Almost in that exact moment that I thought I'm going to see if I can

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
do what he's asking me to

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
do and I'm going to find respect for this person which I found an immense

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
respect for him and he was right about everything that he thought about me because he was

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
the teacher and that was his class and I He allowed

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
me in he let me change his mind about me which

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
was so generous because I learned that lesson that just because someone likes you doesn't

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
mean they're immediately dismissible And just because someone likes you doesn't

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
mean you can't change their. Mind and just because someone likes you doesn't

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
mean it's any of your business as to why.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
But in in that instance he was right and it was appropriate for

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
me to try

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
to

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
to try to be the student you want to be and I did and he let me and it was it was a massive lesson for me.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
You could have been a writer I mean not to anyone would want to be a writer you never get out of

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
your apartment or your pajamas.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
What possessed you to go in this whole other direction I mean I see you as somebody who's a

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
very in some ways I mean you're just you're reading habits

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
are fairly sophisticated but why wouldn't you why wouldn't you

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
set out what possessed you what is it about acting that helped so galvanizing for

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
you that's really the more interesting question and nobody's asked me that is why did you

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
become an actress because my mother keeps

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
saying. I think vindicated.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I said all along you were going

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
to be a writer my prophecy she said to me the other day literally

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
my prophecy has come true.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Everyone knows this Mel. And she really did say

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
that that she felt I was a writer and my whole life

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
that's what I did I made little books and I rode and and then

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
once upon a time. David Grange or let me write for Esquire and started letting me write more and more and more

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.000
and

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I I felt validated in a way that I had never

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
felt in my whole life except for my

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
dad. And his appreciation of me

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
and David Grange or specifically. DAVID Yeah he liked

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
my writing and he asked me to write another one and and so you know I started with

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
one column one piece

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
and. And they I sent it in

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
and they asked me if I had. Written and I says Well yeah I mean I get

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
my boyfriend to write.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
And they said we need to cut it it's really good we might want to cut it and I said how many words

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
and they said I don't like this many and I said let me do it and I got it and I sent it back

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
it's really really good and they said complimentary things

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
and then they asked me to write another one and then another one and then over time.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And it was very male centric I got to write about men a lot so I got to really.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Meditate on that that it's not what I was thinking about anyway but.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So it really is the question why did I become an actor why did you tell me that I was for him over the interesting

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
because no one there really is that whereas me the body ever asked me why I didn't become an actress but I

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
miss I think you said of I don't think

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
so. I'm a short person of

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:01.000
so many of them are short you have no idea that really stand on boxes. Yeah. Yeah.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
So I don't know how I feel I was put on a stage. At about the age

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
of four and I was

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
super quiet and shy and I stuttered I

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
still if I'm extremely nervous will start or sometimes.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
And our Evan was a little bit

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
nervous that I was getting up on the stage foot for some tap rehearsal or something I was

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
doing a dance called the Chicken bop with my brother somewhere in America but

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
I don't know what it had to do with chicken at all I had a yellow costume

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
on and I got up on stage and the two other little girls started

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
crying took their little tutu tool things off head dresses

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
off and I walked out there almost alone and was

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
just happy to be there

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
certainly knowing how to dance or how to sell that dance even if I didn't

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
dance and there's a picture of me right before I walk onstage it's not really pictures of me on the stage and I looked.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
So unbelievably relaxed I'm lying there like four years old and I have this like yellow.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Today. And I get up

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
there and it just felt. And I know it because

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I've seen it in my son when he gets up I've seen it. I know

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
it you just some people you put them there and it doesn't matter how

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
afraid of of of other people they are how shy

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
they are or aren't.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
It's just in some P.P. mind talking about the play I saw you in last

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
year I love Heisenberg Heisenberg A.B.C. the play.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
They say they

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
say can I tell you my idea of hell is a play with two people in it

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
and you know I don't know I'd always feel like it's going to be Beckett or

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
towards some aspect of Beckett or somebody who I want you know not that has to be somebody wants to be Beckett.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And I'm going to be hell.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
And

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
you beat the shit out of that play. Thank

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
You can you talk a little bit

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
about what I love that Iran Syria and you talk about little bit about that but I just

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
loved it

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
and. That writer. Simon Stevens who

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
wrote Curious Incident of the dog.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
He just wrote y'all might know that's why I write this.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And Lynn Maddow of Manhattan Theatre Club I've done like six plays or

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
something on a day when I was having an alone moment in acting and I said

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
I doubt. Thank you just asked her she said I don't

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.000
accept your

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
retirement and I'm sending you a play right now and she's that has hired me since

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I was twenty three years old or something like that and she sent this play and I knew by page four.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
So met her. Can you tell them it's a privilege does a play allow just say a

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
little bit about what the premise of

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
the play was to stream Lee lonely people meet each other but it's really about

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Heisenberg the. Principle in physics where if you observe something

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
closely enough you can never predict where it's going to go or where it is or

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
how far away it is because and I think this is part of it. That

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
which I love it so poetic this aspect of physics to me is

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
that the observer always interferes with the measurement and it so that you have to take yourself out of

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
any equation to know how far or how close you are to

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
something which is just so with have a poet with

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
a hard role for you.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Yeah but I am really only like the hard ones. I wouldn't want to do a play.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
You know with people kind of lunching in the Hamptons

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
and you know I know that could be dialogue. I was with

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
and if I have to feel

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
like somebody like beat the hell out of me every night I it's not worth

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
it for me.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Did your mother want you to be a

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
writer was she like him best you didn't know she just

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
I thought to me because I was always reading and I was always writing and I was too

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.000
shy

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
and and yet when they put you on stage it was like the

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
lips that they didn't show me you know I don't I think if I wanted to not go they would have. But they

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
didn't expect me to run out there. I think is what happened.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
I don't know that I don't know I do remember the feeling though and I remember the feeling

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
of performing even on a tiny

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
level really in some ways this book is an homage.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I think to your father. Now I think in many ways one of my one of

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
my one of my favorite or one of the most moving I buy

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
and sell myself crying at several places in one of the places was when

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
your son was saying Isn't it amazing all the different things we get to do

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
and aren't we so lucky to be alive and you said

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000
addressing. Your your father who lives on the other side of the grass.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
That's you and him.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Yeah that that capacity.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
For astonishment and

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.000
that capacity

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.000
to to marvel at beauty really.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Unabashedly no

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
shame. And how that's going to make you appear.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Some people are embarrassed to do that to really sort of.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Revel in something

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
or marvel at it and my son really has

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
that one hundred percent. He can lose himself in something that he loves so it's that it's

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
a lot of hyperbole lot of emphasis.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Shared between my father my son myself. Everything is so in

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
phatic with what my daughter's so lovely because then she kind of like this sort of.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Equalizing force. You know like she's much. She's more

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
reasonable but true but your dad was and she's nine and she's probably going to have

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
to drive everyone she's

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
like that's right I can't drive a car that my son probably sorry honey should not

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
drive a car. Some of the day that you're a Marine Yeah there's danger from others not drive should

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
not be armed and should not be able to drive not be armed never

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Yeah you know just now you've got exactly and I'm against guns and I but I'm mostly

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.000
against

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
guns somewhere handing me what Yeah you don't want one now that I don't when I don't have one. Neither of those should be

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
or no.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
No

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
but. The driving thing is I feel like you're always driving and you always have

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
people say like you should not be all that try and I feel

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
like people are is that why don't you drive and I think I'm the person that you shout

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
at like Lady. You shouldn't have a my view of might think

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
I am that person I'm saving the

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
world maybe my in a way if

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
only when pressed or you know I'm my cv show I would drive

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
and the whole transpo I'd love that. Department so much they way they

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
tried so hard to teach me

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
to drive they would come out and watch sometimes if I had to drive just because it was

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
funny

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
watching me. Yeah. You shouldn't be allowed to drive your dad

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
was another favorite. Another highlight for me was your grandfather when your

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
father was in the war. Yeah. Send him a

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
cake. Yeah he was a drinker a parent did him a cake

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
with and father with this secret surprise and who I'd not met in the middle of World War

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
two

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
and he carved the guts out of the cake.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
He's a coal miner and small town West Virginia carve inside out of a cake out

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000
of it wasn't an actual cake it was a loaf of rye bread that is a day

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
old love of rye bread carved the got out and laid the bottle of

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Moon chime in in the bread and then sealed

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
it and tried to ice it and mailed it to my

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
father in the Philippines as a birthday gift as a birthday open it up and

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
he knew he saw this this sort of like a horrible moldy

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
bald Reich a dry hooch cake

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000
and he knew it was he knew there was something inside because it

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
was from his dad who was another larger than

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000
life character who never you never met him I didn't. But obviously

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000
and inspired me like I got to meet him by writing it and that

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
was I got so much permission first of all

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
from my agent Eric Simon off because I feel I know I wouldn't have written the

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
book without him because he really I would have sat around for another decade and gone.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I could write about that and even did that with him for a couple weeks so that I feel like

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
everything connects to astronomy now and then I should call it called Black

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Dwarf and I called Black four for about two weeks to is like no why don't we move. Back

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
to just the men that

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
are and you just you know I would jam with this idea that he sort

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
of anointed and made me feel that it was good and sort of just gave me just the perfect

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
amount of encouragement at the

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
right pitch that I could hear and I there wouldn't be a book if wasn't for that and then with

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
man and Graham and Col and Harrison just to have them

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
like give me that freedom and say oh you can you certainly you can write

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
this other chapter and call and one day giving me a massive gift

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
by saying what I thought I'd written this piece about my father and him saying you

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
have begun to write about your father and that to me was like one of the biggest

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
guess that I know that I learned that's one of the oh shit moment. Because then I found the last

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:47.000
piece in

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
the book and I wouldn't have if you had said that I remember when he said it I felt it just put ice in my veins but in

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000
a good way I thought my brain just started working and it was just him

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
giving me that permission to drive in that do you have another book in you.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Well I do I mean I have to have Eric will have to tell me what they are about.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
You can read about me that's what I'll do

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
as well maybe a P.G. thirteen

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000
but I know I do I do I have I mean I

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000
have a lot of things written already it's just the idea for me

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
is to distill them and put them in one direction is difficult sometimes because

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I get overwhelmed by choice but it's the real that compels you rather than

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
my imagination like you get sparked

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000
by the truth and by my

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
experience

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
and these little things that have happened to me in my life these little

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000
moments are when I first saw my friend sing at a club. It just brought back

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
everything including these little bowls of popcorn on the table you know like thirty years

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
ago and so many things like

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
that there's a lot of garbage in this book I think I mean I know that I.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
People don't think of you as a God person but Nabby it's a book for your kind of combing through your

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
the universe looking for spiritual highlights which are almost always

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
moments of connection or admiration or rage or love for holier

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
eighty Well it's a I mean for me it's

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000
a it's a conversation it's an ongoing conversation and

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
it's it's a search and

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
it's and the the words that you use and so cliche it's difficult to.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
To sort of.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Put a name to it but it is something that I look for and I do go to church and I go to

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000
different kinds of churches

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
and and I have moments where it's very hard for me to

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
remember my religion or remember God or remember like on the verite and

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
the moments where I rage against

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
it but I was

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
the first priest that I knew as a little girl was this amazing man is in

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
the book who.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I was involved with different from other men and he was he was gay which

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
I kind of knew on a cellular level my parents knew but no one ever talked

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
about it and chain smoked

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
and. You know drank a whiskey and

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.000
was

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
just the most pure hearted and still is wonderful man

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
who I asked him when I was nine years old and that's one of the moments I remember in my

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
life is there anyone in hell and we were still in church and I reached up and asked him I don't know

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
what provoked me I had to know in that moment and I just remember that his that

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
all of a his response is kind of wonderful he considered he considered might be thought

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:41.000
about

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
it and the fact that he considered it to me met.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Oh you

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
can you can make it up you can think about it you

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
can arrive at it it can be your opinion and it can

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
be an instinct. It can

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
be your own relationship with God It doesn't have to be what. Someone tells you it is

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
it doesn't have to be he didn't say this verse

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
this this but he said but he said like now you know yeah but he thought she didn't need any of

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000
the Holy Ghost said it. Wow now and I said.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
And he's

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
no. And I will never forget that in my head I

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
live bathed in relief exactly oh so much better exactly as but

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000
it made I saw that it was his opinion and he approached it. Like I was

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
allowed to have my own opinion as well and still be a spiritual

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
person. And I tried to do that with my children as well. One day one of my

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
children

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
said I'm feeling kind of sixty forty about the

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
cross thing about did he come down off

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
the cross or not. Sixty five maybe Did you know

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
thirty five maybe did I said

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000
OK let's let's talk about that and see how you feel when you go in there.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
If you feel that way after its OK to feel whatever you want to feel or think whatever you want to think and

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
take from

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
religion or not what you can. But if you do

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
take there is

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
something there sitting in the room with a bunch of people who are

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
trying

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
to arrive at something to be better people and if you find those rooms then religion

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
is extremely useful if you find rooms that shut their door or their windows or

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000
even shut their doors just a crack. Those are the rooms that exclude and you don't want to be in

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000
those rooms but there are rooms in the world where people are trying to find

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
that and those rooms I believe shoot something up into the

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
stratosphere the New York Public Library. Is one it is right

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
is is a cathedral for me. I mean I think books Yeah those are the first lady. For those of us who are

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
book people I think salute leave but where else do we find God I mean you bring

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
your little lonely Ansin off. Forty second right. You get to see the big lions and

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
sit in the reading

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
room and I read this poem the other day that Michael taken my.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Literary publicist gave me

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
that. Linda Linda Greg poem and I'm obsessed with her right now.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Gnostics on trial and I just made my head explode and I thought.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Just those moments when when somebody makes something so clear within the space of

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000
a first or a stanza. It just hits me like it's like a shot of tequila

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
or slap on the face but a good slap if there are good slaps there a good slap there

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000
are good and lower lows that let's tell retarded some we're not supposed to say them. OK.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
You promised me you were going to we should probably be wrapping up but you promised me you were going to

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
read another piece.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Can we can we have a send off

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:49.000
which would YOU can we have a sendoff piece.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Eric's time enough we want to

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
hear.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Your phone this little our dear little Al dear orderly dear orderly.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
What is the future and future man that's

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
good dear future man who loves my daughter.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Oh yeah. First of all show up a

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
bit late. It may be better if she's seen a little of the opposite of you

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
and relaxes in your arms only when she realizes you don't have a gruesome face hiding under the one

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
you first showed her do not have another face hiding. Yeah I really

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:36.000
would

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
not have been

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000
late but not so late that she doesn't trust it when you say you want to make her drunk on

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
happiness make her drunk on happy.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Make her unhappy.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Put yourself first do that awhile do it long enough so that she

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000
suffers when she is done with that suffering which will only make her more

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
compassionate watch as she rises up like the seas last wave. Crushes you

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
with silence. Notice how that silence moves in on you as she

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
speaks telling you that she's had enough and you have to change. You will see her mouth moving

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
and recognize the words falling out and forming sentences that

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
mean quit this moment or I will quit you. But the quiet that continues

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
to threaten with staying forever if you don't comply. That is so much louder than her

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
words she will not be crying are begging she will realize she is powerful

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
and perfect alone and that she doesn't need

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
you her commitment to those words will terrify

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
you careful with metaphor as by then her

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
mother's overuse of it may have exhausted her and made her immune to

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
poetry remind her about poetry. If she has

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
given your children remind yourself every day of the second third fourth fifth and

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
sixth

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:51.000
words in this

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
sentence if you hurt her in ways that are reparable I will send people

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
out to hurt you back sorry but it has to be like

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
that this is the yes you may have had a difficult childhood but please allow me

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000
to introduce myself. Hello I am the woman who doesn't give a shit.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
to drink in the mornings and give her time to begin speaking only Russian her with an embrace or

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
a gemstone wildflowers a love note the

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Eights do not fight with her in public this almost includes the

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
dog she has an elegance that should not be polluted by compromising her

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
privacy this has something to do with loyalty I'm not sure how but it does

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
speak glowingly of her to everyone even on the day she has infuriated

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
you inflate you have landed the loveliest girl walking the

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
earth be a friend to her brother be a brother to

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
him help him out if he needs it and give him the opportunity to help you call him for no

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
reason and drop by with her on days you may not feel like it to make sure they stay connected.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
If her brother is telling a story about me in which I seem especially annoying. Please feel free

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
to poke fun. I want them to take comfort in the fact they share a mother that is

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
only theirs and a childhood as wild and special as they are I need them

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
to have each other it's almost all I

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000
need my brothers have protected and championed me in ways that she will need

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
also my own brother came to the bus stop with me when he learned I wasn't getting a seat because of

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
my rampant. Unpopularity. He stood there arms folded as though he

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
were barring everyone from entering the rest of their

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
lives if they did not comply with his wish to treat me with respect he

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
said nothing but stared into the face of every kid on that street corner promising that

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
their futures were going to remain in question unless they understood all

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
conversations stopped one person's not to look at it at another in his head with Duran

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and to catch both of them incredulously looking at one another try

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
me his eyes said and don't think I

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
want the bus pulled up. I got in line and looked at him

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
still standing there with barely contained galvanic or I tried to convey

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:15.000
my thanks his eyes said back. That's how much.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
