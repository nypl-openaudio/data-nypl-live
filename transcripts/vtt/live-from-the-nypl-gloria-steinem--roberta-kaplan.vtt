00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It is absolutely an honor to be here today and I have to say it's also a little

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
daunting because I now have the job of introducing two

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
women who really need no introduction.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Gloria Steinem and Robbie Kaplan are two of my heroes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Gloria has dedicated her life to women's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
rights. Although some days she must feel like she's living in a time warp.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Robbie has helped change hearts and minds and laws on behalf of the

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
L. G.B.T. community. And even though they worked on different

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
issues at different times in different ways they have a lot in common.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Robbie and Gloria live at the intersection of women's rights. L G B

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
T rights human rights and so much more. And they

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
understand that when it comes to taking on injustice a lot of times

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
you don't pick your fights.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They pick you. We all know the story of E.T. Windsor

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who married the love of her life only to be left with hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in estate taxes after

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
her wife's death. Under the Defense of Marriage Act the federal government

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
couldn't recognize E.T.A. as a surviving spouse. When

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Robbie Kaplan met E.G.. She heard a love story for

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the ages and saw a once in a generation chance to end the Defense

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of Marriage Act. She didn't

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
hesitate. She took the case.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the rest is history. And thanks to Robbie

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Kaplan So as DOMA.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Luu.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now Gloria Steinem took up the cause of feminism at an early age after experiencing the many

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
ways in which the personal is political Since

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
then she's only become. More radical more

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
bold more funny

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
unapologetic and committed to lifting up women of all ages races and backgrounds.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
She's taken on inequality in many forms and she's never

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
ever shied away from a challenge. No matter how insurmountable it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
may seem now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I could stand up here and quote Gloria Steinem all day.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
She is full of pithy wisdom as you're about to see. But my latest

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
favorite quote I have to admit of hers is in response to a journalist who

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
asked what will it take to elect a certain woman.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
President of the United States. Gloria's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
answer what it takes is us getting off our asses and vote.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So the truth is we're here together at an important moment and I'm not just talking

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
about the history I'm hoping will make next November at a time when L.G.B.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
T. people are still subject to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
discrimination transgender women of color are facing a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
crisis that's literally a matter of life or death. When women's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
reproductive rights are still up for debate. And we're still

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
arguing for something as fundamental as equal pay.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There's no doubt in my mind that we need Robbie Kaplan

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and Gloria Steinem more than ever.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And I'm

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
so

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
so I'm so grateful they could be with us today

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and that's who they are and what they represent to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
me but we asked them how with day describe themselves.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Their

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
seven word bio if you will. So

THANK YOU

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.000
THANK

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
YOU

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.000
THANK

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
YOU

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
THANK YOU so I'm a star I have I have a confession to make.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
When I was in high school

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
all my mom called me up one day and said she had tickets to a book reading of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
a book called Outrageous Acts and everyday were about me. And what I like to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
go and so I went to a book reading for you in Cleveland

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Ohio and I must to read this blog five hundred

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
times and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I had a little confessed to him looked at it until today and just looking at

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the chapters. Again the chapters about how I was a playboy body.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I remember and the chapters.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I don't think could raise your head for this one if men could men straight. It's

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
almost it's funny the degree to which you know just

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
reading those words again brings back the memories I

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
had in the incredible admiration and inspiration I got from

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
you back in one nine hundred eighty three when I was a pretty

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
naive maybe a kid of early

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
feminists growing up in Cleveland Ohio.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Someone asked me to sign it again because I don't know if I can find my.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And you know I my I was talking earlier about

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the show I think she's a word and it's right the intersection between feminism and gay rights and interests.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They're so intertwined.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
For me growing up even though I think I had inklings for sure in

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
glimmerings that I was a lesbian the much bigger issue for me was

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
was being a woman and what I'd be able to leave would I be able to move to New York and be like

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you what I be able to fulfill the dreams that I read in New York Magazine in Ms

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Magazine that was a much bigger issue

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
because being gay I just figured I'd keep it in the

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
closet. And there were many years where being gay became a big

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
issue and

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I think I've come full circle today for me at least being a woman is in a lot of ways

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
a tougher issue in the rarefied world that I live in them than being a lesbian

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so my first question to you is you know how do you see that intersection. You know you

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
have a long record of this but how do you see the both the relationship in the way the two movements have kind of evolved

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
over time.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And my heart I think I don't see it as an intersection I see it as a circle. You

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
know and we're coming at our goal

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of being unique humans and

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
also sharing our human. We're coming at that central goal from different

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
places but I would say it's like this not a hierarchy you know

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000
like this and we are all linked. We're not ranked.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
But what worries me sometimes is that I think our adversaries know

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that somehow we all have the same adversaries. They know we're dealing.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But if you think about it in the most basic terms you can understand

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.000
why

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
because the whole idea of a male dominant or patriarchal or

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
or and or whatever you want to call it system is all about.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Trolling reproduction. I mean that is the basic thing. How

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
many workers how many soldiers who do they belong to then also if you

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
have race or class

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
or caste as in India then it becomes even more important to

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
control reproductions of that you can keep these groups separate and because it's

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
all about reproduction it demonizes any sexual expression

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that can't end in reproduction.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So sex between two men between two women is terrible for the

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
same people who are against contraception or against safe and I pray you know everything

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
everything we know and it's just so important I think that we not see ourselves

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
in silos.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But we understand ourselves to be absolutely intrinsically

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
allied Absolutely. You know

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I'm thing about if you're talking everyone so while the law. Can kind of recognize that

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
circle and it's actually just happened in this context because the Obama administration the

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
E.E.O.C. just took the position a couple months ago in states that

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
don't have protections for gay people civil rights

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
protections. You still can't fire again person from a job because it's sex

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
discrimination under Title

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
seven and there's this inherent realisation that even under the law

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
treating someone differently or because of sex. It's because A said.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Yeah I want to well the law catches

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
up.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
You know I so admire that you have this crazy idea that

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the law has something to do with

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
just

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
touch

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
the I've read this book and I tell you when

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I when I graduated

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
from college. I kind of had this little idea that maybe I could be a lawyer.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Except that a lot of law school for exempting no women and Columbia are some very

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
liberal places accepting five percent

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
women. And my. Career

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Advisor whatever's vocational advisor said Yeah well you could be a lawyer and you'd end up

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
doing a states and wills in the back room of you know no client or a

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.000
dead client. You

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
know. Or you could graduate and do research right away you know

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
so I never became a lawyer and I'm so proud of you are you not proud of this

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
one

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
hundred if I'm ever in jail. I'm calling you up.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I promise you I'll be there another one trillion. And I won't show you a paddy.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Oh I have a license to do a lot

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
of good you know the other thing we are I mean I think we

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
we have to cop to this right where two little girls from Ohio.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Who dreamed of coming to an icy other Ohioans holding

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
up their fists. The whole city of New York I think is former Ohio.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Who dreamed of coming to New York. I think New York is a symbol of freedom in all

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
kinds of ways.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And I am sure I've been in this room filling out little by hand.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Slips how many people remember this was the reading room. I think originally was

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
it and. Doing free research for some article

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I was trying to get paid for so the ghost of that of our

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
former selves are here

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
too and you know I think it's so important to say that because

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
otherwise we in our earlier selves would look at us now and

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
say think there was some barrier that we couldn't do it but we

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
can and. I bet everybody here is a kind of you know those

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Russian dolls. You know that are nested like

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that so inside is our child self and our adolescent self

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and right. And we're all here and it's OK we're.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I mean it's. And I would talk about this I mean that I do have this

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
amazing connection because Korea started a New York magazine right.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And then MS and my mother has this question to both and I remember in Cleveland.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You know really I couldn't wait for the new issue came to the

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
door and it of about the age of ten. I decided I was moving to

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
New York. No matter what and I was ridiculously logical about I was clearly going to

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
be a lawyer because I decided the way to do that was I go to school on these coast and I go to law school in New York

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
City and that's what I

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
did. A little scary quite frankly.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
You know but reading your book I made

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
me feel.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You know because somehow your I don't I don't never met your mom so I'm going you know

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
anyway she was very part of the women's movement and reading mills

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and doing all that but you didn't feel supported by her

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and being who you are and saying you're a lesbian service. So that to me

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is a shortcoming

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
of what she was reading. I feel kind of you know I

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
mean we.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We always you know I mean the very first issue

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
of Ms Magazine actually the editor of Newsweek at the time took me to lunch

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and said OK the only way you can possibly succeed with a feminist magazine

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is by making clear that it's a heterosexual feminist magazine against

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the lesbian parts go you know. So naturally we had a huge lesbian article

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
first

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
so. We were trying but maybe we weren't trying hard

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
enough you know that was a society. I mean it is much as feminism was a

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
new thing that in founders I'm definitely inspired the early gay rights activism I've been reading about

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
it just recently Lilian faded man's book. I mean it was you guys you gave the gays

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
at Stonewall the gay people stonewall later the guts to do what they did

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but I really think it you know it talks a society a

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
long time to come around. And it would have happened without the feminists doing what they were doing people would have

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
just stayed in the closet.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I think I think the shared.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Magic. It isn't exactly magic that ordinary magic is telling the truth.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You know and I think that the women's movement allowed women yet to

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
say here is my dream and I'm not doing it or I'm getting beaten up

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
at home or I'm not getting paid or whatever it is just telling the truth and that is the

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
source of all liberation movements really the one person tells

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the truth

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and then three others say you feel like that I thought that it was

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
only happening to

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
me you know it's always about you as you do that and you go around the world missed your book as you go around the world telling

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the truth. Well I mean the one thing to tell the truth in the court romance

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
easy but also the way to

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
me You go everywhere in the world and tell the truth in

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
environments. You know I don't I don't I mean I get to listen you know.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And there's no magic greater than a circle of people telling their

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
stories listening to each

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
other everybody gets to talk everybody listens and I

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
think a great rule of political change is as simple

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.000
as that too

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
because if you are a more powerful person

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
in this particular situation whatever it is be sure and listen as much as you

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
talk and if you are less powerful Be sure and talk as much as you listen.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Which is sometimes even more difficult.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And you know that's the path. If you keep doing that organically

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
you'll you'll get

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
there OK So here's a question I have to ask you

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
so with within my lifetime within our lifetimes we've seen this incredible

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
change for gay rights we've also seen incredible change for women's rights. Seriously.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I never thought that I'd be able to do what I did I'm sure you never saw it growing up the Lido that you would

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
think you know I was trying to tap dance my way. That was the height

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
of my practicality if I learned how to tap dance surely I'll be able

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
to write. What what can the movements learn from each other and how

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
most importantly how can

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
we the incredible rate of change was just like a game might have been

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
extraordinary how can we accelerate women's rights and other groups rights the same way.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Well I do think truth telling is I mean for instance I mean the most obvious example

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
is abortion and in the first issue of Ms Magazine we have like I don't

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
know four hundred women who said well known women who said I have had an of it was then illegal it

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
was before the Supreme Court

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
ruling and I demand the decriminalization and so

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
on so you know one in three American women has needed

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
an abortion at some time in our

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
life and I think if we all came forward. It really came

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
forward. I mean the tactic of the right wing which is now move to state

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
legislatures since they couldn't get what they wanted to end a choice folks in

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Washington and get a constitutional amendment and all that they moved to state

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
legislatures which they control for other reasons and

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
just you know the first they murdered what eight abortion doctors and then they were surprised this

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
wasn't popular so they stopped doing that.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Then and

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
now they're they're trying to do it through state

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
legislatures and there to if

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
we came forward and if we paid attention to

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
most Americans don't know who their state legislators are and

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
they are those are crucial because those folks are redistricting

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
themselves into perpetuity. Which is why the House

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
is Representatives is more difficult.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
For the majority to win than the Senate you can't redistrict that state. You

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
know I think the path the path is

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
clear but. It may also have something to do

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
with sheer numbers.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Because everyone has lots of people have one of us at home.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
The sort I was telling my dear friend

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
from Carlin who worked on the case with me tells a story about Rob Portman for a while so

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the center from Ohio Rob Portman is very conservative man and he was

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
very anti marriage equality until one day he woke up and

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
his son said to him I'm

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
gay and it changes mine and I'm

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
not critical of that and that's the way people's minds get changed I think that's a good thing that he changes mine

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
but that's the problem is that he's not going to wake up one morning and find out his

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
father's African-American or needs a green card or probably not going to find out he has

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
a daughter who wants an abortion and it's that you're actually right it's that kind of truth telling

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
that kind

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
of that that creates the empathy I think that we kind of lost in

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
our

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
society and as. I'm trying to

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:10.000
think what his wife could say to him.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
It's

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
you know is it just the sheer the sheer numbers make it make it hard

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and also that women generally speaking still have two

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
jobs there still tend to be raising the kids much more though there are many more men who

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
are raising kids now

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
but it's still very very

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
unbalanced and it's it's just big and deep but

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
it will happen. I mean it will happen I. This may seem bonkers what I'm about.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000
But what helps me to know what will happen is that it was true in the past.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I think we study history in a way that causes us to

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
believe it's always been like this and it's human nature somehow and

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
it's inevitable but if you go back. Just five or six hundred years

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
here where we now are this is manna hatter this island when it

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
was you know before the Dutch and the English showed up it was a man I hadda. And that

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
meant that right here on this land there were.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Matrilineal cultures women and men were part of decision making groups women control

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.000
their

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
own bodies and decided when and whether to have children which they knew very

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
well how to you know they were incredibly easy gallop we would say gala Terry and they

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
didn't say that but nature

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
connected cultures that didn't even have words for he

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
and she in the language people were people mention

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
that. Or a word for nature because we weren't separate from nature.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So this may I don't know if this seems practical to you but it helps me to

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
know that ninety five percent of human history as far as we can

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
tell was different and so this

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
patriarchal nationalistic colonialist stick.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
What

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
else heterosexist telephone homophobic.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
It's bullshit monotheism monotheism I mean

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
if God is a man man is God You know I mean that came into being

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
for God used to be in everything in all living things

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
right until it was withdrawn from females and nature to make it OK

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
to conquer women and nature. OK I don't. This helps me I'm not

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
saying it but I

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
literally go out into Central Park and put my hand on those big outcroppings of

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
igneous rock and I think OK another hand was here and

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
people were living differently and I feel kind of intimate Lee connected to what I think of

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
his vertical history as opposed to horizontal history.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And I think in each human being is kind of what you're saying. She was being whether it's about a C. a stick

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
or not there's that spark of the divine and that we need to see that spark of the divine and in

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
each other again.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Yeah. In all of ing things really I mean that was that was. Maybe

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
not everywhere I don't know but I mean the quiet in the sun in Africa

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
the cultures of several hundred cultures that were

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
here and

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000
India was there. It was there so we can do it in a new way.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
OK I have to ask you about the the non elephant in the room. What Hillary

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Clinton definitely not another don't tell you are really in the

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
realm which is I understand that in

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
the past you thought you were worried that she couldn't get elected to be the first

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
one president of the United States but you've come to change your mind and know who would know

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
better than you so tell

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
us why i love and I like your bronc I don't know I don't know anything

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
that we all don't know. OK the reason in two thousand and eight I thought

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
that she couldn't win. I mean you know first I supported them both and then

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I supported Hillary because she was more experienced but they were the same on the issues so you know. But anyway.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
But I thought it was too soon for her to

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
win because most of us are raised as

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
infants and little kids by women and we deeply associate female authority.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
With childhood and

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
emotionality and you know nurturing and we don't

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
see women in that's already in the outside world so I think we almost when we

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
see an authoritative woman out there. We think

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
we can't. It's hard to get used to and. Some I think men especially

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
on television who the T.V. commentator actually felt

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
regressed to childhood when they

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
saw because they would

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
say things like oh I cross my legs whenever I see Hillary

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Hello.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And there were some very serious bad stuff on campuses there were a whole lot of shirts that said

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Too bad O.J. didn't marry Hillary.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
You know. And only worn by white guys is in my

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
experience anyway. Right so you

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
know but now I think that there has been enough vision

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
of women in

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
authority in the world outside the home

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
that that it's going to be hell but I think it's I

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
think it's possible but I do not think we will be able to

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
really use all of our human talent until both men

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
and women are raising kids and both women and men are in the world. The rest

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
of the world.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I mean it's almost as if I mean I really it's almost as if though the first one present has to have probably the

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
best credentials ever right. I mean there's no presidential candidate ever who has a kind of background

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
the right is Hillary Clinton but that kind of makes sense

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
given no and she had to prove it again and again and again and again.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Right right right. You know absolutely. And though there is another

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
reason to to me too which is

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
that. Violence against women has now. I mean

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
females worldwide is so big so frequent.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
In all whether it's son preference

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
or S.G.M.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
or sexualized violence and war zones or honor killings or domestic violence

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
or whatever it is it all adds up to the fact that now there actually

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
are fewer females on earth and males for the first time I don't know that that's right.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So we really need to think about that. But

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
also what we what we also can absolutely

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
demonstrate is

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
that the biggest. Terminus of whether

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
or not somebody's going to be violence in the streets of a country

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
or internal to a country or that country is going to be willing to use

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
military arms against another

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
country is actually not poverty not access to natural resources

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
not religion or even degree of democracy it's a violence against females.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Because that's where we get the idea in the home that it's natural that one group dominates

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
the other to some degree and sometimes a huge degree and then we

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.000
think it's

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
inevitable and in the circle again because that's when you see the same kind of violence against gay

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
people right. The same countries where the lynching Game

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Yes no absolutely it all it all the same absolutely goes

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
together and the reason I say that now is because I think

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000
that that Hillary Clinton is the only person who would to my knowledge.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Who is running who would make that part of foreign policy.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Yeah you know who would understand that that is an important first person who made it by the foreman.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Well so yes in Beijing. She did her best to say I mean she said women's rights are human.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
But you know the if if we had not

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
aided the Mujahideen who were overthrowing the

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
government and Afghanistan because why

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
because women were being allowed to go girls were being allowed to go to school

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
women were had to give their permission to get married and women could go to political meetings this is why

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
they overthrew the government in Afghanistan.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And we aided them. We gave them. We armed them

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
because we thought that government might be a little too friendly to the Soviet Union.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
So I mean you know it's just it's crazy it's crazy not to include.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Half the human race in the way we think about for right now we included but we know it

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
would be nice. It's the end I would. Nice would be nice the girls go to school but it's

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
not serious you

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
know and again the same thing with you Secretary of State of insisting that not only are women's

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
rights human rights the gay rights are human rights. Yes coming out so forcefully for that and

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
making it clear that's not a question

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
of relevance. I think that she once left the White House and marched in the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
gay march of some kind from the White House without a lot

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
of

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
it but I remember when she was running I mean I've been in a lot of gay pride parades in my time as you can imagine and

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
in the one that we won when Sir was incredible obviously and in writing with

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
either but equally I think is powerful was when Hillary was running for

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Senate and she marched in for some reason I was marching very close

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
by and the role or when we went through the village. You know as

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
a Rhodes there I'll never forget that I mean I don't remember this being allowed only one Windsor It

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
was incredible and people got in there got that they had a champion.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
OK But here's something I mean in the same way that I find it a miracle

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
that Hillary can withstand the amount of.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Opposition and tension

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and. Spotlight And so I signed it a miracle that you could

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
stand there in front of the Supreme Court the Supreme Court.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.000
I

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
mean you know. I was always I never spoke on public until

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I couldn't publish what I wanted and I sort of inadvertently went out and started to say

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
but you as a kid you loved to talk according to your book right.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
OK So but what did it feel like standing in front of those so

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
just so when you go

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
to records for people who've been there or have been it's

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
very formal as you can imagine and the room is beautiful and when you walk in and

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
you're facing the judges there's that's true there's this enormous red velvet

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
curtain and that you walk in the curtains closed and then the marshal announces that there can start the day in

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
the curtain

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
opens and Charles and the justices all come up.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And I remember when I started to speak I mean you can hear it on the tape. You know I'm a

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
little you know going through my brain was

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
like oh my God Oh my God Oh my God you know I'm just a Jewish girl from Cleveland Ohio What the hell am

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
I doing here.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
But and it would be no different for you Gloria but pretty soon you know it was

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
just like OK this is like any other case it's obviously much more important but I've argued cases

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
before and I think in a crazy kind of way I guess I'm a little bear submit this

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
but when the justices kind of came at me the hardest it ended up motivating me

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
more and I remember thinking to myself OK you know I understand you don't agree with me I

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
understand you're a little irritated with me but you know what I'm from New York

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
City and I've argued against a lot of judges in my time who are more than

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
a lawyer to with me this is actually pretty mild by New York City standards

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
and it almost motivated me more the other thing I have to say is let me be

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
clear I've gone idea of whether this had happened but during the argument. I had been given

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
advice that I should look not shockingly to

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Justices Ginsburg and Kagan

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
that if they thought that I needed help or they would I should look to them and I certainly

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
should agree with everything they

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
said and I should kind of float their way and it was very lucky they didn't ask

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
many questions that was a good sign I got almost all my questions from Justice Scalia sitting right there

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
and Justice Roberts right in front of me. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS But at least

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
in my head I kept looking they both sit on the right and you're facing them I kept looking to my right and

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
just Kagan says all am I right. And this could have bit of my head I don't know if I was

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
hallucinating or not but I remember every time I looked to my right I'd see and I think to myself

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
OK Kaplan Kagan still smiling. You haven't screwed this one

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
up yet the

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
stuff Well I think. And again I don't get you simly anything to you but it was just such

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
a relief in my own head at the time and I was like OK you're clearly doing something

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
right or not asking any questions. OK that's that's the end. The

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
movie I think your book should be a movie.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Because. You know. It's

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
so incredible that it's the kind of thing that can only happen in real

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
life. It's could not possibly nobody would believe it in a novel

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
that you knew that you want to tell the story had a little getting of

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
the book suddenly this is the beginning of the movie but you could never get away with if

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
it was there to check and I want to believe it so I got this Con two thousand and

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
nine from a friend of a friend who said I know this woman by the name of any Windsor she had to be a

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
huge tax bill because Adama and she wants to sue.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And I had no I had never met eating WINSOR. But I knew

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
exactly who she was and she was not the celebrity she is

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
today some was not because of

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
that the reason that I knew is because eighteen years prior to

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
that I was in my third year law school and I had been I think it's fair to

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
say kind of a late bloomer in terms of coming

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
out I had thought about it in high school I thought about it in college

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
I certainly thought about it in law

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
school but I waited until the bitter end of my third year law school to kind of have the

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
courage to do or say

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
anything just my luck. Just as that was happening my parents were coming to

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
visit. My really bad luck I'd clearly done terrible planning its turns out

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
it was Gay Pride weekend so I was in this one bedroom apartment and

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
one room really studio partner in the Upper West Side and my parents coming to visit me had to kind of when

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
their way through the parade and by the time they got to my apartment they were in quite

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:37.000
a

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
state rules Messinger was on the Manhattan Borough president and her daughter marry him had been

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Mike my college

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
roommate and so my mom kept saying oh I can't believe who's Messinger was leading the

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
parade what she proud of yatta yatta yatta I said to

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
my

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
parents stop and ask. And as mothers and daughters I want to do my mom continued.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And then I said the My mom said so why are you insisting that we stop. Are you

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
saying that you're gay and I said

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
yes and my mom kind of my worst fears became realize because my mom

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
walked over about three feet to the side of the the room and literally started hitting her head against

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
a wall. I'm

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
not it's not a Christian my mom my mom really has has apologized ten million

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
times for this and could not be more proud she's so excited that I was on the stage with you I can't even

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
tell you. But as you can imagine I was not you know I was pretty low

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
at the time and I went around asking in New York I need a psychologist the way you spoke back that

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000
it was

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
good to gain issues and I kept getting the same name the name I kept getting with

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
the Aspire.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
For those of you know who know I say here's a gas the U.S. buyer was in these files.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
And I actually went to see her as a patient twice because I was moving to Boston at the end of

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
the summer twice in the very same living room that I then met EDI in in two

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
thousand and nine C. it was already paralyzed completely so she saw patients in her living

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
room and here's the craziest thing about it all is during those sessions she talked about

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
T.V. Now I'm not a psychologist obviously but it's my understanding the psychologist don't

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
really talk about their own personal

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
lives but I think Thea must a concluded and she was right about

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
this that the only way I was so low and I was so cynical that the only way she

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
could persuade me that I could have the life that I wanted is to tell me about her life.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
So she told me about this brilliant mathematician who she been with E.T. WINSOR.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
She talked about her being a brilliant computer programmer which she was she kept talking about eating when dreaming

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Windsor and I again I only saw her those two times I would see her

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
after that in her wheelchair at the foot of their building during Gay Pride but I never approached her

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
and I was make sure she was there but I never poacher and then when I

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
it's two thousand and nine I'm in these apartments and I open up the door. And even though

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
I obviously knew where I was going all those emotions came right back

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
to me almost like going right back to the year one thousand nine hundred one when it happened and I

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
said to E.D. look I got to tell you I've been here before. Let me tell you why and

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
then the second thing I said to if you so don't look what I imagined you to look

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
like I

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
should think about you being a boy mathematician I thought you have like a slide rule and like a class.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I like

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
you are not the late the I describe you and that was the

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
beginning that we started the case that

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
day but I mean you know this is why life is so much

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
more weird than anything that could be said and thought was of it right. Can you see I mean you

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
wouldn't last it was true you wouldn't believe a movie in

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
which eight the first scene is eighteen years. You know and this

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
suffering young woman is coming to see a therapist. Who

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
then eighteen years later becomes the person who

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
dies and leaves her partner and in this case becomes a Supreme Court case

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
which is

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
that not a movie. I mean that's a but

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
it's the big question the play even thank you could make a play even.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And the other thing is I remember distinctly is thinking is I'm going to pay Thea back for helping me.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
This is my

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
chance to pay Thea

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
back but it's just such an incredible

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
coincidence and you know in a way that's why I believe I mean we'd probably own good that's why I believe in

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
the divine. I don't believe it's

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
just coincidence I know it sounds sappy but there's got I mean I

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
believe there was something that brought us together something that we can understand is you know maybe

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
we put out by brave. We're at right I'm going for that but what if

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.000
what

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
it what it made me think of is

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
that in a way

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
that's what we share about the stories we're telling

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
is that if they were fiction no one would believe it. I mean the things

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
that one experiences me to. On the road and you know the people you

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
meet in the.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Crazy coincidence situations and and if you're on the road long enough it's like a novel

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
he made you know the person you haven't seen for forty years discovered some amazing

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
thing that

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
it's it's love I can't believe all you know what's

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
the saying that happened to you on the road most similar to that. Just most similar to that

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
other so many it's I know you didn't run into your psychologist on the

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
web

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.000
but

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
it's you know I will.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Here's here's just their thousand examples so I don't know but once I got an American

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Airlines plane and there had just

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
been put off the plane

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
a African-American. I think they were still called stewardesses then I'm not sure if they

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
were yet flight attendants and the

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
pilot who was like many pilots an ex-military guy and so on

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I had put her off the plane he had basically said he wouldn't take off until

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
she got

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
off because a she was she had an afro which you know

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
those you know they really regulate what flight attendants look like and

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.000
especially

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
them and be she was carrying a copy of Soul on Ice.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
OK What year was this. Well it must have been the very early

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
seventy's might have been the end of the after the very end and it

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
got in the newspaper.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
So I always remembered it you know and then of course

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
it's like thirty years later I mean I wasn't worth remembering it

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
anymore and I was someplace I think Seattle in

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
a radio station where the manager of the radio station was a woman which is

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
rare and she was showing me around you know.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
In a great way and you know smart terrific woman.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And as I was about to leave she said Do you remember a story by

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
would put the last woman off you know because she had an F. And I said

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Yes I've never forgotten. She said Well that was my husband I divorced

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
the

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
bastard and

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Lucy said I went back to school and I'm doing this is I'm having a wonderful.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
mean you know and. There

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
are I there are

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
thousands of stories like that that's just unbelievable and you just keep running

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
into them. You

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
know I mean I go back to a hotel someplace in

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
the Midwest after the whole campus event and I'm exhausted and so

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
on and in the lobby are like forty people

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
from the convention older

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
older African-American men from the Negro Baseball

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
League right. Who are having a reunion. Wow.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
You know one guy's in a wheelchair somebody else offensive. So and I sat there for hours

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
listening to

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
stories that would be. Right I mean it just happens all the

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
time all the time. Once I was coming back from. A

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Again a campus lecture and meeting in

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Boston and I had to leave the very next morning for some odd place

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
and Africa I was going I don't know but anyway

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
the the kids.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
I missed the last plane from Boston to New York for the kids got me a car.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
With a driver to drive me home so I could sleep along the way and gave me a pillow.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
But the driver said to me that he used to be a truck driver.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
And. And we started talking about his truck driving and I did you ever see the

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
movie they drug by night. You know it's an old French. So I thought that's what it was. Like

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.000
that he

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
was he was homesick for this dangerous dangerous dramatic to say no

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
he said I miss the community. What do you mean the community you're driving by yourself isn't but me sure.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Anyway we stopped in every truck stop.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
All night long

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
between New York and the between was Boston and New

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
York and I discovered another world there is a whole world that is alive

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
at night. There's there's music songs that are truckers

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000
songs that you know are incredibly popular and maybe we've never heard them.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
There's a whole system in which you said at the counter and you can get a slab of lemon meringue pie a

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
cup of coffee and a motor oil can a motor oil all

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
of the same time in which order.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
There are worlds out there there are two worlds and if you just go with it that's the on the

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
road state of mind.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Actually you know it's interesting I was just as I was reading

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
your book an edge of time the story I remember this year actually during

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
the the Jewish New Year my my friend and Rabbi Jenner back gave a whole series of

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
teachings about the concept of home in exile and the point that she was trying

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
to make which she says is very she thinks is very much part of our tradition is

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
that oftentimes you have to go into exile in order to find

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000
home that traveling in seeking is part of the human condition.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
And that we all have fun around why did she say exile I wonder why mission time about

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
the metaphor of Jews as being an exile and whether that was a bad or good

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
thing and that in this idea I think

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
that home is a place that you have to many of us have to search for right.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
We have to tell our truth and we have to search for our homes and only by traveling and going

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
on can we do

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
that you know that that is more my experience of course because I

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
haven't suffered exile in the way that was massively suffered

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
but what I've done. Covered over time I think is

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
that it's not settling down or being on the road I mean in

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
this case it turned out that my parents kind of represented I hadn't thought about it

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
but my mother never had a journey of her own.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
At least not after I was but she had earlier in her life but I didn't know

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
that and my father who lived in his car. We lived in the house trailer never had a

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
home and it took me a long time in my own life to realize that the

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
whole point is to have both you and I don't think we're told that you know we're told we have to

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
settle down or with you know and I think we but you know because just

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
from our the our genes you know we've

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
been following the climate

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
following the animals forward but with our group and our yards and

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
our whatever. So we we all need

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
to be on the road and to have a home both I think in a kind of

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
balance completely should we is

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
a time yeah I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS WHAT TIME IS IT. We want to hear from you. We can't see you very well

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
but we want to hear.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
we're bringing bring in the light you are proud right but don't be shy and I could take questions

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
from Justice Scalia I can probably answer yours.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
if you don't you don't have to ask questions you can give us answers that would be very good.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.000
You

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
can also make announcements of you know whatever outrageous things. We need to know

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
about and we encourage everybody to come up here and line along this center

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
line and. Please speak and the microphone. Thank you.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Whenever I see this it shows my child I would think of Phil Donahue know him as like it's my

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
lifelong dream of being on the Phil Donahue

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Show. Hi Thank you for

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
coming from honor to be here.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
I I wanted to say you have a. A definite philosophy

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
about women having control over their own bodies and that that gives

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
women independence and

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
freedom. But you know

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
up and yet that has occurred.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
And women are still not making earning as much as men

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
and I happen to be in the banking world and. You know in terms

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
of women progressing at the same rate of men the way women are seen

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
the way women leaders.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
How difficult it is for them and that's just thinking I think was

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
the same right in terms of women actually being acquitted partners in a law firm

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
and that's pretty rare. So it seems like that's not the

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
only answer. You know and

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
I'm I'm not saying you have to have the answers.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
But where did the women's movement go and what happened to and why are

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
people talking about these issues that's one and two why

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
wasn't there a huge outcry when Henry

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Clinton with interviewed for a Levin straight hours.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
I mean why have there if you're

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
right it wasn't you. And I couldn't believe

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
that everyone was an outrage by that she was abused publicly.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
She's running for president. I mean so I guess my main question is what happened to

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
the women's movement we arrested. It's right here its word hello was a member of the realm of the

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
oppressed Thank you Lou.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Now it's never enough whatever it is this is never enough but the E.U. know the

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
a gale Collins is you who is she here someplace now. But anyway she wrote

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
a brilliant New York Times op ed page

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
piece about those eleven hours in which Hillary look

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000
presidential and you know serve as a guest.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
You know so. I mean I think people were pissed at the committee for their treatment and

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
their waste of money my God they wasted millions of dollars on this Benghazi

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
but that actually the balance

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
was mainly on behalf

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
of you know I feel or my sense is a certain point of time she knew that she had it and she was like

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
OK go on you can just give

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
us some more stupid question to ask B. is yeah I said and then putting the beef be

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
my guess

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
it turned out it turned out to be an

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
advantage as as for either women controlling

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
our own physical selves from the skin and I mean that's that's not the only

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
thing that's just a basic thing because whether or not you can decide when and

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
whether to have kids is the single

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
biggest

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
element in whether you're educated or not whether you're healthy or

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
not whether you work outside the home or not and how long you

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
live so it is a fundamental human right to just

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
for all of us men and women the power of the government stops at our skins I would say. Could we

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
do you think you could make this

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
principle on about only integrity next OK OK no problem. Well I'd like to order up

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
a principal cause the IFTIKHAR I mean you know when i'm thing about it is the concept

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.000
of kind of the

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
a keenness factor that used to exist with respect to gay people we've got rid

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
of right. Pretty much or in a lot of American culture not everywhere but

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
we've certainly made huge strides and it's it's different for women but

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
we need to make those same strides and it's not just about integrity it's about

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
how we're seen and how we're perceived and what people expect from

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
us say it's really the same thing it's

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
just we've got to figure out how to do it the way we did it with respect to get it

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
right and we have to do all kinds of things in order

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
to demand equal pay which of course we do not have

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
and Wal-Mart and all kinds of big corporations are making a fortune. Off the underpaid labor

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
of women and

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
having women present I mean I hate to sound sappy but it will have a huge impact I mean how many little girl

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
I mean I never thought there'd be a woman president when I was growing up so that will have a huge impact

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
on not only all the kids growing up there but the way

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
people see women right. But anyway in answer to the one who asked

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Where is the women's movement. Give us your e-mail.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.000
How

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
do you every single.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Now. Definitely not now

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
but the great thing is about goals is that their dreams you

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
move forward right and you keep getting new ones.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
And you meet such great people along the way like you.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Me.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
During.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:09.000
I was wondering where this was.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
When you were originally and I was going say

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000
it's making me it's so painful to watch and

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000
scary when you originally set out.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
What gave you the

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
inspiration that you could

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
have the change that you would. And if I

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
can ask you for you.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.000
What's

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
been what's been the impact of

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
MS over time. Do you mean the magazine or your form of address

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
or Oh the letters.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Well what what gave me the idea was just.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Realizing that I wasn't by myself you know what we were saying you know telling the truth about our

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
lives finding that somebody else felt the same way well. Hello. Maybe if

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
we do X. and Y. You know we can move forward to

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
get you know I think we're communal animals I don't think we can do it by

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
ourselves but. But you know together we can do

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
it and what's been the impact of MS You know we get

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
we hear stories of people

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
who saw the first cover

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
about battered women and started a shelter or we or

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000
the my the piece we did the that turned into a

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
movie or this I mean those are all you know there's tons of.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Of stories that we hear but I suspect that those of you in the audience

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
know better than I do you know what it's incorrect but it's still the

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
only magazine for women that's controlled by women and it

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
is the only one that isn't influenced by advertising.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
So is you may notice in other women's magazines especially because their

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000
catalogs even though the editors are always trying to get something in there.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
The articles are mostly about product.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
And we don't have to do that in fact we've lost fiction and poetry from women's magazines too

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
because of the advertisers won't pay to be next to it so. So we haven't had as

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
much impact as I would like but I think we've had quite a lot of impact.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000
So in the movie Truth which everyone should see there's the scenes about Dan

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Rather leaving

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
C.B.S. actually also a movie about sexism. But there's a scene when the young

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
reporter talk to Dan Rather and he said What got you into journalism and Dan Rather

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000
said Kerik says curiosity and he turned to the young reporter and said look at you into

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000
journalism and he turned to the guy and says You got me into journalism.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000
I did what I did because when I was a young kid growing up in Cleveland Ohio in the suburbs

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
I read Ms Magazine.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
So there you have

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.000
it one. Thank you Fredricka.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Why it's so great to have you both on this stage together and really mind

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
blowing actually and I have a question for our Because you're both up here and want to highlight for

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
each other and Larry's happening

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
earlier about how we're not ranked we are linked and I do believe that I would love to be a

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
helper holic but the civically around abortion and

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
getting more allies to support in this kind of work

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I wonder how how we move forward because I keep seeing political issues being

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
very diluted like if you're going to vote you have to vote on this one thing and if you are going to give money have to give money

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
to this one thing and all these issues are really

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
connected. And for women I think that abortion can be a key to many more of these issues.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
And I would love to hear how you think we can move forward.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Well I mean I do see you know truth telling and understanding that

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
reproductive freedom reproductive justice is a fundamental human right.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Like freedom of speech or anything else.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
So you wouldn't vote against some vote for somebody who is against freedom of speech so you know

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
just treat it like a fundamental human right that a true truly is and that means

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
the freedom to have children as well as not to have children you know it

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
really is both

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.000
things. Telling the truth voting giving money.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
I don't know I dedicated my book to an

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
abortionist and I'm glad every day. Because I

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
may be a. Maybe I should explain what I mean by that what I meant.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Because it was kind of it's quite personal women know because I

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
think we have to tell the truth personally right.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000
OK This book is dedicated to Dr John Sharp of London who in one nine

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
hundred fifty seven a decade before physicians in England could legally perform an

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
abortion for any reason other than the health of the

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
woman took the can. Literal risk of referring for an abortion a twenty two year old

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
American on her way to India.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Knowing only that she had broken and engagement at home to seek an unknown fate

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
he said you must promise me two things first you will not tell anyone

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000
my name. Second you will do what you want to do with your

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
life. Dear Dr Sharp I believe you to know the law

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.000
was unjust would not mind if I say this so long after your death.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
I've done the best I could with my life this book is for you

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
and

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:44.000
you'll

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
thank you Lou that's my thank you

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
that's that's my story and but you haven't you all

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000
have. Unique stories we need we need to you to tell your story.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Hi I thank you both so much.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
So this is looking to you both for advice with them. For

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
me and my other fellow twenty one year olds whatever way of college

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
and

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000
havening are hopeful activists and what we can do to use our power

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
and our privilege and our energy fully to effect the most positive

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
change you

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000
think you know I think we you know some to me like you're probably already doing

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
it number one number two you know I think we have to work we have to find allies we have to

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
work together. It's not a coincidence that the same Republican presidential candidate

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000
who thinks there should be abortion even in the case of rape or incest things that the

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
worst Supreme Court decision of the last hundred

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
years was over the father marriage equality incision in Windsor.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000
So we know who's on the other side and we need to work together with the groups on our side to

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
have common cause to convey. And ourselves and

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
then the rest of this country that we're on the right side of

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
history that I mean the two most obvious powers we have our

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
vote power. I mean the voting booth is the only place on earth where the

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
least powerful and the most powerful are equal. OK there's no other choice that

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
we have to remember to use it and we have a very low voting rate in this

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
country and dollar power. You know those are two but I think we

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
worry too much about what should we be

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
doing and the answer is and the thing you can

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
every day. It doesn't matter little or big Just everything we

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
can all be honest with you there are nights. Maybe this is a sign of age but it's

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000
embarrassing fact that with you know

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
those so much tougher than I am but there are nights when I go to bed and I've had a tough day and I'm like

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
oh you know can I really keep fighting all the times I really want to keep fighting like

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000
this the rest of my life and then I wake up the next morning and at the thought is gone and whatever

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
the fight is that day I go fight

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
it. That's all we've got to do each and every day. And a

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
little dancing after fighting. That's

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
the.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Heights of a great honor to be here. First I just want to say to you that I was a teenager in the one nine

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000
hundred seventy S. and I was a very young feminist and the impact on my life that you

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
had is so enormous that I had not just advantages

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
but I knew I can do and be whatever I wanted to do and be in my life because of you.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
So the question I really have is about the term is the title Ms because for

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
me it was so exciting that women weren't going to be known by their marital

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000
status and I don't think that's changed my sister in law said to me not long ago that

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
she thought her MS was for divorced women and as I raise my son.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Mrs for the single women and Mrs All the teachers are Mrs except the single

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
teachers and their Mrs.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So I just behooves me and. Fifteen Is that still the

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
case a mine site. In the seventy's but it wouldn't be that

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
way. Well it's it was never meant to be imposed just there as an

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
option I think what's happening is a lot of people don't use any form of dress at all

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
you

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
know mess Mrs A but MS actually is a

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
very old term from I don't know those fifteenth century of the fourth or something

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
in England that it was you know even kids were known as mistress

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
and master right. So it was an abbreviation that just meant female

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
without marital status and we put it out there as an

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
option and Bella Abzug you know made it a congressional bill so the

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
government had to offer it as an option to bellow I Wish You Were

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Here.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So it is an option but I don't think.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
We let me just say is one of the oldest people in the room.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
It's not like it used to be that you had to be a Mrs or it was a disgrace.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You know that you. Or the Mr or Mrs You know I mean it used to be so

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
much worse.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But now it's just much more open to options of what you want to call yourself.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I do think it would be helpful though if people

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
who have kids name you gave them both last names.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Of their parents because

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
otherwise. Otherwise people are walking around as we speak saying this is my child when I

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
first married. This is my child. Then we know who their parents

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
were what their parents were

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
but but then they can choose whatever name they want when they get to be eighteen. That would

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
that would work better within the age of computers. You know you'd have

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
individualized names. I mean I would say languages and really important and one words we

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
use and in the brief in Windsor I was obsessed that we not use the phrase.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
As a homosexual heterosexual because my view was if you're comfortable with a gay person

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
you don't say oh there's that homosexual couple cross the

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
street you say the gay guys across the street and so you know I was very clear on the other

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
hand my wife is sitting right over here and I tell you we find using the phrase wife kind of

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
liberating I mean you know first I was a spouse and it was kind of this people didn't really get what I was talking

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
about and I'd be like oh

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
here's my wife Rachel in the crazy kind of counterintuitive way

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
that itself was liberating So I think the one thing we know about language is it has a lot

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
of meaning and. We have to think about what language we're using and what we want to lay with

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
that and then we each get to pick I mean I was thinking when you were saying that the you know

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I was married for three years and we could never say husband and wife

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
because we were male and female it was just too like giving

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
in so we used to say the friend I married.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Oh.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Thank you both so much amazing to hear you both.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Hi

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm an Australian career driven

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
litigator to want to holiday I didn't know and did met a New

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yorker and never having thought I want to get married got married a month ago or and I'm now in New York

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
US are hearing you guys talk about travel and exile and finding yourselves a very appropriate for

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
me right now. But as an

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
outsider in this city trying to find my community and listening to you talking about truth

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
telling I feel very much like this is a city

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
where it's very segregated. At least for

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
an outsider coming in and I want to hear stories and I want to listen and I want to learn

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and. My experience of the Internet at least is that we heard at the beginning

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
about transient transgender women of color and that seems to be a

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
huge flashpoint at least on the Internet when you want to hear about a story because transgender women and women of

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
color are by feeling at least in that space very

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
exiled from the feminist movement and I find New York a place where it's very different

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
difficult to listen or. Even find communities to listen and so I just wondered if you could speak to

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
how we listen

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
properly and how we listen in this city

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
or people that are white women of color as much as I love listening to you very. I

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
mean why women

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and I mean how do you find your community here saying.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
How do I say how do I listen

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
to people that I just not in my community because if I if I really want

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
to properly do that listening to truth telling I want to hear the truth telling

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000
of difference as well and I find that very difficult to access.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Well that's a that's a big question and I'm as an organizer

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
tempted to say.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Tell me what you're interested in give me your email and we'll try to find you the right. You

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
know I don't know if

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
that's practical or not but it's here I just want to tell you it's here and you know it's here

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
it's probably in this room. You know I always try

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
to say to people the before you go. Introduce

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
yourself to at least four other people you don't know.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
In the room. You know because if you came here you probably share interests and values

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and you know you could end up with a new

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
friend a new love affair or a new job and who knows just

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
from tonight. You know from introducing yourself. So try

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
that

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
but seriously if you if you if you say just tell me what your interests are and I'll try

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
to

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
be a bridge. OK thank you I mean I actually think this is heartening I mean I think the internet

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
is amazing and it's made. Life so different and so much more efficient and.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Giving people access to knowledge and so money incredible ways but I think it also can alienate

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
people and I

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
think we lose we're losing touch with the value of face to face yet a reaction.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And so the factor of so many people are here and we're having this conversation. Is a good thing we have to make sure we

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
don't lose the art of that.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Yes and I'm so glad you said that because I asked my

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
friendly neurologist. If the. Oxytocin

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
the tendency of you know what allows us to empathize with each other is produced on the screen

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
or the page.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And she said no you have to be present with all five senses.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So impressing sound is not doing anything either because

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
even if you click a

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
lot.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Hi

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
So my question or a similar question to mine was

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
already asked so I just want to take the time to say thank you to both of you I think both

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the movements that. You guys have both been so involved with just have been so inspiring and have

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
given me so much joy just like a small example of that I watched

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
incredible documentary.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Last winter called She's so beautiful and she's angry about the second wave feminism

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
and I

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
had this smile plastered on my face the entire time because as hard as these types

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
of movements. Are there just there's so much joy in that community and

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
the people striving for like what is

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
right and I just went home and tore through all these like books about women's history and like that kind

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
of brought me to like discover my history and so I'm just like

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
thank you thank you very much. OK When I write

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
the SO BIG Do you know the woman from Australia who just spoke.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
The Thank You to each other.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
OK. Thank

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
you

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
so I mean and this Mike is very tall hat and my name

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
is Meyer Bernstein shallot I'm seventeen and

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
my mom got married this summer after twenty seven years of being together.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Thank you just wanted to thank you thank you thank you because that

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
made a huge difference in my life. And my family's

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
life on a separate note I'm really interested as a young

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
person about what you were saying about the liberating power of truth telling.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And I'm wondering what you would tell your seventeen year old

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
selves knowing now that you had a life ahead of you of liberating truth

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
telling what advice would you give

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
yourself.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I would give my advice to give myself the advice of my grandmother gave me which

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
is trust your gut always do what you think is right it's sometimes going to

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
be scary but that's the only way to live your life. And I was I was lucky enough

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000
to have a grandmother who told me that and that's was good pretty good advice.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:45.000
What

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
would I say to my seventeen year old so I guess I would say

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
it's going to be all right.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Thank you.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Hello

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
my name is Sophie I'm also seventeen and a daughter of two

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
women lawyers and there's nothing wrong with that.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah thank you. And they've definitely inspired me to go into law myself.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So this was kind of a more legal question

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
but how do you think the court should continue to interpret the Constitution

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
such that it leads to further into human

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
rights over to fall where we were granted the right

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
to marry. Look I mean you know the Supreme Court is

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
very dependent who the justices are on the Supreme Court and big cases like Windsor and over

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
the fell. There's gave a great quote a Justice Kennedy said case

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
a swing I don't

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000
but he is the vote that decides cases and it's always very important and

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
he has this concept that he's

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
developed really coming from world view. Wade of human

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
dignity in the importance of respecting human dignity under the Constitution.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
He himself has he said it today. Has has said that he is certainly interested I

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000
think in applying that in other areas. Certainly with respect to. Incarceration.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000
People who are in prison and. Really have no access are in solitary confinement no access to people perhaps.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
In connection with the death penalty that remains to be seen there are a lot of other

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
issues that need that that principle has to be applied so I'm just being realistic with this court right

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
now I think those are the two most promising

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
areas but we need to go you know much broader than that and we need to make sure.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Again going back to what Gloria said that we elect politicians who put justices on the Supreme

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Court who will honor. Those principles and will continue to extend

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
them as in to future

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000
generations and I think I mean you know this better but I think if we had an Equal Rights Amendment

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
absolutely in the Constitution if women were actually in the Constitution.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
We would I think for instance we wouldn't have lost the class

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
action against Wal-Mart. Absolutely

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
because as it is we have to prove intent we have to prove

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
state of mind. Another word the discrimination was present massive

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
factual provable. But it's very hard to prove state

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
of mind. And that's what we're producing these people write a memo and look at who wrote

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
what in that opinion who wrote the dissents look at the gender of the

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
justice right to dissent in the Wal-Mart decision and it was just its glory is absolutely

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
right thank you so much.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
First thank you so much for being here you're both such fears of mine. It was actually a paper I wrote in tenth grade

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
on Windsor inspired me to go to work and

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
activism something I'm wondering as I'm going to notice of a teenager even growing up

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
in New York City is that the way that I have learned

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
about human rights and about activism is it is a lot through the Internet and

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
through discussions and things I read on the Internet. How do you think that both the old G.B. team.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Plus men and women's rights movements can work either individually or together

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
to use the Internet or technology tool for affective activism.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I think word. A lot of people are doing it already right I mean the just.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Huge waves of publicizing something that's wrong that gets fixed

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
because everybody had access to pooling

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
this information that never otherwise would have gotten in in

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
the regular media you know I mean there are people in

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
this room. You too you probably know better about how to organize on the web and

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
mean.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
It's so you know I would just say.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Make sure that what's on there is accurate because there is no big fact checker in the sky which

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
sometimes makes me nervous about

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
science and also remember as you were saying that all five

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
senses are still know the and we the best use of the Web is

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
to figure out how to meet and how to actually

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
act and also remember that it is a little economically divisive because

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
not everybody has access to technology globally not

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
everybody is literate and the big majority of people who are not literate

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
are females I mean we we can't so fall in love with technology that we don't forget that

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:27.000
it

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
is sometimes divisive. I mean here's the here's my dream. This is my dream.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
We have a

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
satellite. Which broadcasts and talk every

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
language and on the ground we have wind

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
up radios you know those you don't even need electricity for right. And you don't need to

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
be literate you can get I mean you know we need to keep on democratizing technology

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
too and I think it's Leeson the L.G.B. team is the most

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
effective organizing that was on the web. The kind that really told people

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
stories and then showed the humanity of what we were doing and not just the

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
abstract principles and we have to see each other's

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
humanity. Thank you so much.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I have a similar question just wondering like as a seventeen year old queer girl.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000
If you have any thoughts on the federalization of lesbian sex like as

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
an intersection of the marginalization of women and like the old you need to commute.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Well I'm the wrong person to answer this question I'll tell you why so at the beginning of the case.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
We had a press

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
conference with the Windsor and I was in a room like this and someone asked

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
her a question. Saying it was a perfectly good question and said you know you and you were

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
together forty years. What was the secret of your

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
success said keep it

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
hot and then she proceeded to kind of go into

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
this some detail about how to

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
time and after the she did

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
that in the you have to remember buying why but I took her aside and I said Look E.D.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I said we have to think about this case in terms of who our

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
audiences and our ultimate audience are nine justices of the Supreme

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Court and I don't really want them reading I think I

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
said I don't want Justice Scalia reading about your sex life in your boats in fam

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
rolls before the case gets decided I

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
said after the cases aside you can say whatever you want. I don't care but while this case is

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
pending you have to agree with me that you're going to then she great she followed her

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
into the bargain the day the case was decided all

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
right she said to me all bets are off and they were all off

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
so I definitely played the role of the prude in our relationship ended up working out pretty well.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So if you have a question I suggested you have to be winter and I guarantee you should give you a very

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
detailed

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
answer. Thank. Thank you. And I'll be

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
happy to do so for you but

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I want to be there. What she had to say.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Good evening my name is Vanda and I wrote down my question while

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
standing in the line as I tend to be nervous. While speaking in public.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So I came to New York all the way from Prague Czech Republic which is a country

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that suffered for half of the past century under the tile the tearing communities

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.000
regime where we've been told that all animals are equal but some animals equal.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And because of that old grew tired of talking about equality as a desire.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
So many of them in Central and Eastern Europe has a long way to go and the fight for gender

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
equality is especially difficult in a society that label seventy S. movement.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
As yet another ideology that wants to tell people what to do. So what will

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
be your piece

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
of advice for feminists from a ready young democracy that is still struggling to

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
find distinct voice and I'm talking both about myself and my

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
country.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
That's so big I don't think I mean I think you know so much more. Yeah of

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
the I mean I would trust your instincts about what to

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
do but funny you were saying that I was just thinking that you

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
know Marx and Engels were inspired

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
by the Iroquois Confederacy

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
here and that was their idea

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
of first idea of primitive it wasn't primitive but anyway communism.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
So and they unfortunately kind of left out the woman part somewhat

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
although

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Engels was better than Mark.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
So I think

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
it's partly understanding that the forms of equality that

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
were present in that system were not really the.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Forms that you want right.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So in a way the very word equality got devalued.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
So again as to its telling the truth telling

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
stories organizing together. I mean you know

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
there's there's no there's no substitute for that.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000
But what do you think should happen. I mean wouldn't.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I sense that you

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
know so much

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
but. I definitely do not

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
have the right answer if I would have

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
the answer I wouldn't be standing in the light for ten minutes.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I mean as being part of the feminist movement in the Central

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
and Eastern Europe and fighting fighting against

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
a backlash within the mainstream

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
society where people would say things such as oh you know let people

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
decide whether they want to lead a parent decide whether they want to go

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
and spend some time with kids at home. As if there would be

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
no structural you know.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Inequalities that will force women to you know. Spend more time like cats

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and not building the careers. I have

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
to say that you know we look both the U.S. and North of

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
the Europe for inspiration and you know we just keep on

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
fighting because if we sort of believe that it will get better because it can

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
get any worse.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I mean it's not shows like it but I mean it's been very inspired by the woman who just won the Nobel

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Prize who I think she's in either Ukraine or Belorussia I can't remember which

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
who's really a truth teller and has she was the first journalist to credit when

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
the rebels right here. So there are women out there but it's hard I know

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
that. Yeah I would say that the most difficult thing would be to convince people that.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
The truth telling is really truthful. So maybe

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:14.000
that's the hard part but anyway. Thank you thank you.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Firstly thank you so much for always

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
including even using that as a verb in the life of your

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
career the inclusion of everybody has been so remarkable

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
the gospel of inclusion.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000
You know not just women and men and black and white but everybody.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So I have three yes or no yes or no questions we get through this really

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
quickly like a cross-examination

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000
and I and other than you if you have it the first one is your two years in India.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Is it's at the basis for how you were able to deal with them

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
in Detroit the basis of how you were able to with

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
such great deal with the admin in Detroit for example you didn't like go

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
and try to kill them or

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
anything you

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
actually. Brought them in it at that crucial time when you were that's so

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
interesting because I mean that's trying to sell ads in Detroit for Ms Magazine flashes

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
before my head before my mind

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I don't I don't know if I I mean India. It

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
taught me how to organize all it took me a long time to figure that out because I didn't I came

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.000
back thinking that India had no application here and took me along right.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
But

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
you know I I just gave up on Detroit

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
actually I mean that's why you

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
still had really difficult interactions with people and from what I've

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
read which is a sense of is it that you were never a jerk. You know

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
you weren't like I mean you. You know you

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
were really looking at the person not to

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
be honest I think here's what saved me always OK. No one could

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
fire me.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000
OK. So you have. I think all. Yeah no I think all movements need a

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
certain percentage of people who who who can't be

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
fired who are independent organizers so much. If my livelihood

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
had dependent depended on those guys in Detroit it would have been very

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000
different but I could say things that the women who work for them couldn't.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And then I could be in cahoots with the women who work for them and find out in Seville you know I think

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
we all have have different roles to

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
play

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
but you know I've done some pretty terrible things at the

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
enters the house

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
and I wasn't always so Gandhian about the whole

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
thing and I'm not even talking about that I mean he had his

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
problems too I mean you you you seem to have had

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
a

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000
spiritual you know I don't know whether it was in dealing with them or the Midwest you know I

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
come right you

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
know where Ohio and what that means is you have to be on L.S.D. to know whether we're

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
having being angry.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
OK So that was your demeanor all along and I'm just reading into it right

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
now and then your i'd definitely didn't do yes or no I was sorry

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I got that I got it so that the one hundred seventy seven. Do you think in Houston.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
If you

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.000
had let's say. Equalize the.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Rage or play with Phyllis Schlafly that. If you

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
had gone to her level of trickery. That would

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
or would know. I don't think so this is the national conference in Houston which is

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
in the book and is like the most famous meeting nobody knows about you know because it really gave the women's

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
movement massively our agenda of issues and and so

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
on and you know would we if I if we had behaved

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
like fellow Shockley would we. Have the equal rights of women no because it was

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
really an economic interest against it so us laughing was just a window dressing room.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
It was really the insurance

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
industry. One of the last I think the last industry

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
not controlled federally but can troll state by

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
state and they didn't want to equalize their actuarial tables that would cost

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
them a lot. They had to do it by race. It would be much worse if they had to do it by sex

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
they didn't want to do it and that's why we lost Equal Rights Amendment. It was you know Phyllis

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Schlafly was kind of the window dressing. But it's

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
still there I mean we still have your a but it's super

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
under Yeah and we have to go back and get the right.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Franken. All right I'm just going to

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
leave it.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Just in the interest of time we're going to end the line at the very end there.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
So all of you will get to ask your question well just so you keep it brief please thank

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
you and we'll try to answer shorter.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Hello. I'm a recent law school graduate and I do believe that the law can bring justice.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I focus on reproductive justice and I'm much too nervous to form a coherent question for either of you.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So I'm standing in a room full of feminists I would like to just briefly give voice to an issue that I

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
think many families perhaps most eminent don't even know is going on in this country which is the

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
widespread criminalization of pregnancy I would call it. I'm talking

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
about

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
court ordered to scary in

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
sections arresting pregnant women because they allegedly use marijuana and that's going to harm the

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
baby harm the fetus.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
It's based on the same idea that the anti choice movement is based on the idea that the fetus can

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
have rights that outweigh those of the woman

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
carrying it. I so I just want everyone to know about

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
that and you can learn more at an organization where you

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
say in turn National Advocates for pregnant women.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Yes that is a great organization thanks to all advocates for pregnant women is

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
a great organization that's absolutely true that women are in jail as we

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
speak because the fetus is valued more than they are and they are.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Right it's completely and constitutional but it's happening.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Thank

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
you very well thank you so

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
much both for being here tonight. I just want

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000
to say that I felt very inspired and

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
your comment really resonated with me that Gloria. And the voting booths were

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000
all equal and I just wanted to raise that.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Next month. Elizabeth Cady

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Stanton the organizer of the first. Women's Suffrage conference in

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000
eight hundred forty eight will be celebrating her two hundredth birthday and.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
She won't be

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
here. I want to thank you so I would have given her a birthday

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
gift but.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Instead to celebrate her birthday and the spirit

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
that runs through you

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
to give you her birthday gift.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
You know it's a shirt. And it. It's kind

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
of symbolic for the women in the world

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
who and humans in the world don't actually have the right to vote. So

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
this comes from China.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
The translation is this is what a feminist looks

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
like it's trying to use all that for all if that happens. Oh

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000
thank you so much.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Thank you

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I thought thank

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000

Wow

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000
thank you I should add that was what we're all equal we get into the voting voting the. There have been

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
my way too many sometimes successful efforts like a local

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
power to block people from getting to

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
the right

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
you I just the Krillitanes living in Brooklyn no famous great

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
great grandmothers

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
so.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000
For all the really quick Hispanics I think I can speak through this.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000
First I just want to say thank you so much I'm so excited to see you both here and especially Gloria for

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I don't know how many times like you answer the question by asking the person to look to their own power which I

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
think makes you such a bad

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
ass and really quick for the Australian woman if you're looking to hear

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
the powerful truth. Of trans women of color right here in New York City. I recommend Sylvia Rivera Law

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Project Audrey Lord project Community Health Care Network and I bought houses like the godmother

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
of all trends at the nose living in New

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000
York. It's right here you can take the F. crane what to stop the

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Twenty third street I promise you we're here. OK. Two

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
questions and it's one for each of you like a grand prize here.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
OK So you said our vote and our dollar that was your answer

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
to what we can do and what hope do we have what hope can you give us with

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
how much our goal in our dollar has

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
been devalued and decimated by corporate interests who get so

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
much more of their vote and their dollar in our

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
politics today and follow up for you. You being

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
the amazing constitutional lawyer that you are what hope do we have to see a

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
change in the case law that led up to Citizens

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
United which really was just the final coffin. I mean the finally on

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
the coffin of case law that really perverted the thirteenth Amendment. What do you see as the hope

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
for future case law

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
to overturn that case. Thank you

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
for introducing this in the United I

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
mean it has a majority on the court. I think it was a five four

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
decision just. I said before that means there's one judge who essentially is

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
voting swinging the

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000
case and in order to change that we need to have another

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
judge be the swing vote in that

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
case. And that depends goes right back to the voting booth. That's plans on who's president and who

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
they nominate to be on the Supreme Court there are people on the Supreme Court right now for getting on

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
in

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
age and they're going to be retirements and we need to make sure that the best candidates

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
replace And there's also the possibility of Congress passing of a Congress passing

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
something this Congress is going to pass anything but there's certainly the chance of Congress trying to do

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
something but both of those fronts are very important.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You know we're certainly shamefully economically divided and you know we don't have

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
to go into how terrible that is but it's also true.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And I've seen it happen. That organizing and getting out the vote

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
can defeat money.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000
It can get to be television ads can defeat. You know it's a lot of

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
work but it's absolutely possible

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
and worth it.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.000
So you know we have to start where we are and that's that's what we're

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
that's what we've got and we need contagious movements

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Occupy is contagious black lives matter is

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
contagious. It changes

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
consciousness and I feel in you the ability

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
to change consciousness. Thank

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:39.000
you Thank you Lou.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Good evening. Gloria and there there been a few things you said this

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
evening that have really resonated with me it would be that you see you look at the rights that

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
you fight for and you characterize them as human

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000
rights you talk about the linkage of the issues so that it's really no one pitted against the

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
other that it's a self reinforcing

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
circle. Gloria you spoke about the linkage to nature and how oftentimes a way in which

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
we look at society now it breaks that.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And then sort of reflecting on the fact that you speak about though the work that you do is represented

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
representatives of movements. I work in the climate change space. It's a pretty

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
big year in the climate change

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
space and we're sort of at a tipping point of no return if we don't take the actions

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
now we might we do and and in despair. I hear the voices

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
of the youth movement standing up and being counted. I hear the voices of the

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
poverty movement doing the same here from try unions

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
and not to take away from you know voting power against money I

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
actually also hear from the corporate movement. I'd be really really really gratified to

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000
hear from the two of you here on stage what they L.G.B. team movement and what

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
the agenda right. The tennis rights movement could contribute to this issue

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
because it's an issue that essentially effects everybody. And it's an issue that needs to be

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
addressed now.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I mean Act I could agree with you more I think you know I think there are people I mean you have the pope is your ally which

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
is a good thing. I mean his and circled on this is beautiful when we have issues with other things

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000
he says and does but he's beautiful on climate change and we have to use that and we all have to we have to get a

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
broader coalition as

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
possible and convince the rest of this world that you know

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
this this planet is a

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
gift. And we have to honor that gift and respect it.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I mean I think people get it in their gut but we need to put it into action I mean I think the

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
L.G.B. dimness fully behind you and perhaps we can lend some resources as

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000
we get some successes of late. I hope so. I'm thinking

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
about the pope.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I'm

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
very grateful that he spoke about global warming that was very helpful

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
because at the legitimize to a lot of people who were denying global warming.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
But

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000
and he's not part of the L.G.B. team

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
is that you know I think

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
is as long as he and all the other patriarchal religions

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
are saying that sex is in various ways that sex is

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
immoral unless it ends in conception then we're going

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
to continue

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
to grow the single biggest cause cause of global

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
warming which is the load of the overload of

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:33.000
human beings on

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
earth born because not because women chose but

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
because they couldn't choose right.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
So I you know

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I I'd love to talk to him and say you

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
know. I agree with you but here's what you're doing

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
that's undermining what you care about you

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
know and just to be clear that he did not have a private meeting with Kim

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Davis' fundraisers. Thankee by

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
famous.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
This is more of a comment and a question I've been a college professor for forty four years.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I expect to make it to around

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
fifty and so I've seen the movement happen in from it's almost as earliest

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000
days until now at the very beginning of my career might my women students

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000
would ask me whether I believed this was their language whether I believed in the women's

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000
movement because it's like gravity. You know. There it is it's not one doesn't believe

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
or disbelieve it simply is about twenty years ago I was

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
hearing things that went more like this I'm not a feminist

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
but also from my women students and I just cut them off and said yes

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:46.000
you

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000
want your hear your in a university you're getting an education. What do

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
you think feminism is. I was prompted to get out of my seat

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
now to come forward because I was watching the line.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Of young people everyone who spoke

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and half my age who you

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
find were find because of you trying because of you and were fine because all

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
those kids. Sorry kids all those young people got up and spoke about their

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
passion in this world and I personally feel great that to you because you

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
came just a little bit before me you were my

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
beacon and I tried to pass it along as well so thank you so much for being who

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
you are and for setting the

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
bar

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.000
lul

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
thank you and thank you for Project thank you for making a place

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000
of growth in your classroom and for all the young people like that want to know so

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I do you

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
you lose my question is not unrelated. What should

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I say to decent men whom I love who are afraid of the word

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
feminism send them to the

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:15.000
dictionary to say that they're wrong.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Send them to the

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000
dictionary and they will say is they will see the feminist I mean we all know we

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
can say it in unison is just a person male or female who believes in the full social

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
economic political equality of men and women males and females that's

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
it so because a lot of their disapproval is probably based

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
on misunderstanding of what it actually means.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
And if it is based on. Understanding what it

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
means get rid of

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
them. Thank

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
you Thank you Lou Thank

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000
you you so I waited all this time in the back the one you

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
clearly have the courage to do so.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Should that happen. Thank

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
you. Thank you

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
you'll be OK all right but don't forget I mean

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I think we're out of time right OK so you don't have to do this if you don't have to

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
do anything. OK that you don't want to do

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
but why not introduce yourself to a couple of people you don't

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
know while you're here and who knows what might happen.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
THANK

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
YOU THANK YOU THANK

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
YOU FOR.
