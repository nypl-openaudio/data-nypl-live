00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you thank you very much Tony.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
My name is Paula Holden Graber as you know I'm the director of public programs here at the New

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.000
York Public

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Library and I want to say that my goal is to make the Lion's Roar to make a

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
heavy institution dance and when successful to make it levitate

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you'll also be very happy to hear that today.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We booked an event with them awesome fantastic

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
storytelling group in in late December in early December of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
next

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
year and the evening will in some way be about roaring lions and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we decided that on that day it will be the last time that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I will ever say the Lions are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
roaring so another that. My my

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
wife will be extremely happy when she hears that tonight because she's had to live with this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
for ten years.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This is a Pen penultimate event of the spring live from the New York Public Library season.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I would ten Senate verse three spring season next Tuesday we end with

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Vanna had a conversation about his love for ancient Greek

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
literature and the evening co-sponsored and Co presented by the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The event is sold out but it will be live streamed and you can

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
always try your luck by coming on standby.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I invited. Elizabeth Alexander because I fell in love with her

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
memoir the light of the world and wrote her a fan or rather a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.000
love

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
letter. I have done this a few times before for instance

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
was adamant while upon reading that here was amber eyes and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Patti Smith just kids.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Both Edmund awhile and Patti Smith's responded positively to my letter as did.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Elizabeth Alexander and both Patti Smith and Edmund one will be back

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
this for. For

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
more it is just my hope that Elizabeth Alexander will also

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
come back sometime soon to the New York Public Library for

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
more Hilton Adams and I cooked up

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
a plan some years ago for a series of events that has not

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
yet happened. I hope there too. We will

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
revisit what we could do together in the years ahead.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
After the conversation which will last about as long as a psychoanalytical session. If your

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I also want to thank our spring two thousand and fifteen season media

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of Celeste about us and Amanda and Adam Bartos.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
As many of you know for the last seven years I'm not going to retire that I've

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
asked my guests to give me a biography of themselves in seven

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
was a haiku of sorts or a few very modern treat.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Elizabeth Alexander submitted these seven words to me

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
mother poet

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
teacher race woman evolving subject to

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
change Hilton and submitted

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
these seven words reminiscent to me to the seven words

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Joan Didion submitted to me some years ago the seven words she

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
said do not yet define me Hilton as seven.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I do not know. So cannot say he's welcome

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Louis

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Louis thank you all for

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
coming to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
my. Song which is a little

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
warm and. I want to read

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
this.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Introduction really to you as a way of celebrating

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Elizabeth and the event.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Introductions are a strange

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
practice but a necessary one. Usually polite at the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
core fact based and essentially a centralizing.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Particularly if the host or audience

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
only has a cursory knowledge of the subject. But N's case none of

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that's even close to the trees. I feel as though I've always known

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Elizabeth or known her. And in that knowing which includes her work as

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
a poet a legendary professor in the L's African-American studies department.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
A bestselling author and strong a committed mother of two. There

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
are perforce a multitude of feelings that cannot be contained in an introduction.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So the project at hand is kind of moot. As a stance Lee speaking.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But since we are

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
on Earth and this there is a task to

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
perform. Let's begin with

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
her birth in one thousand sixty two and Harlem USA and her

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
heritage which includes the people of

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Harlem and her father Clifford Alexander Jr former United States

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
secretary an Equal Opportunity Commission and her mother the very beautiful.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Adele professing West taught legions about black women's

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
lives and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
her brother Mark who has been a senior adviser to. And Obama. During his

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
first campaign and forgive me if I'm leaving something

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
out the point is Elizabeth a self described

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
race woman comes from a house not built on history lost which

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is where most black Americans live but history gained. And your

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
ear had to be in your foot. If you didn't hear

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that in her poem Praise Song for the day which she read so exceptionally

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
well and beautifully President Obama's two thousand and nine swearing

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in and there she

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
said we encounter each other and where

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
words spiny or smooth whispered or declaimed

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
words to consider

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
reconsider and that's what tonight will give us a list with

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
words and some memories which might include the afternoon she read at President

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Obama's first swearing and which was the swearing in of some much

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
more stuff too including Elizabeth national prominence

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
as a poet and it was the swearing in of Elizabeth the playwright author

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
of diva studies a play for her late husband freakery loved and it was

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
also the swearing in of Professor Elizabeth

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Alexander author of the two irreplaceable essay

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
collections two thousand and four as the black

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
interior in two thousand severance power and possibility. Now we

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
have Elizabeth the memoirist the

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
poet working in prose and her bestselling but the light of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the world which chronicles her nearly two hundred twenty year love affair

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and life with Fakhri artist and Chef father and

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
friend of the spectacle of the Spectacle Man who bought Black

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
difference into Elizabeth's black

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
America which is most of our America. And if you listen you

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
know that Elizabeth is its true laureate. Ladies and gentlemen

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.000
as myself

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Durham

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
thank you thank

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
you I have to say the rather young man is taking

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
my questions.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I mean.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Thank

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
you so much.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
With you.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Well this is something I've been wanting to do for a while

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.000
only

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
because you have given so much of yourself to other

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
people and it is a rare person who does that without complaint.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I never hear you complain only hear you reinforce and

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
support people and societies that you love.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
That's going to be something that comes back in the conversation as a theme but I want to

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
start really with

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
words. And to talk about

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
your life as an artist.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Which you sometimes put to the forefront sometimes

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you receive from in order to foster the talents of others but

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
there's no stopping you now with this book.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So let's talk a little bit about little Lizzie

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
M. and how does she have a she come to

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
be herself as an artist.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
A little Lizzie

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
was a girl a child who dreamed at

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
night very vividly and who would come downstairs

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to her parents and thank you for calling their names and. And say I had the most

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
extraordinary

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
dream. And if my mother who know to be elegant and dry were

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
here telling the story. She would say and so we would put down whatever other things we

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.000
were

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
doing all else would pause and you would

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
say what you had seen or been visited with the night before. And so

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I think that I give that to my

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
parents who and I never knew that

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
other people didn't dream wildly or remember their dreams all the time

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and it always surprised me featured a the most creative person I ever

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
knew was not someone who very often remembered his dreams.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So that's probably where it began and I think also with

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
listening and listening to the way that people spoke list. Listening to the different ways that

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
people spoke around

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
me listening to a Jamaican grandfather with one particular inflection one

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
particular vocabulary listening to and I've talked about this before my

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
father's great elegant Harlem

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
swearing that was just like nothing else thrilling. You know he would pray for

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
traffic so that we could hear him just you know carry on and he does

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that now my children think is the most entertaining. Ever

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
seen and my mother's tremendously

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
elegant way of speaking and understatement.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And hearing

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
the traces of Alabama in my grandmother's speech and

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
seeing also the different

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
kinds of words that she used and would credit to her great

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
teacher at Dunbar High School in Washington D.C. miso to Yulia Cromwell who years

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
later I discovered

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
was one of the first I believe the fourth African-American woman to earn the Ph

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
D. and that she received her Ph D. in English from Yale. So I felt that

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that person my my my grandmother. Correct my English and

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
say that is what Miss Cromwell told us. And so you know. Clearly it seemed to

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
me that the circle needed to be closed with beginning to research her work

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and reading her

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
letters about her time finding her

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
way at Yale in the one nine hundred twenty S. and wanting to write about black people

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and saying to her father but certainly I didn't come here to learn how to do

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that so I will let these people teach me Shakespeare.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And I will then do what I have to do which she did in one thousand thirty one with her first anthology

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
of African-American writing for teachers.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So I think that you know there's all of that and also of course reading you

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
know also reading and I think that all of us are children who

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
read and read and read and read.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Yes and read everything and read what we're supposed to and read what we're not supposed

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to and read ahead of ourselves. We don't read under

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the desk and secret talk things you know beneath the mattress

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and read. I think indiscriminately. Yes and just

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.000
put it all

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in there was something extraordinary moment and

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I Met Your Mother for the first time recently. And there was something something very

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
powerful about her presence

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and one of the things that I would say was so unique

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
about her was that she was a woman who stood square and she looked

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
human and it wasn't about. Defiance or

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
being annoyed by your presence it was just that she was looking to see who you

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
were and one of the things that I love about your writing is

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
that you know if you go to let's get into the

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
individual violence but if you go through Listen to this writing the female

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
character whether it's Elizabeth or someone else that you're dreaming about twenty miles.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And so on they're women that look you square in

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the eye. And one of the strange. I feel about Europe.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And the USA is you're looking at a street

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Square and at the same time you want us to tell tell you who we are. So

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I'm interested in learning a bit more about the kinds of things you were reading

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that spoke to you about the kind of directness emotional connection interestingly.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That is such an interesting observation and. I think I

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
can you know answer it a little bit on politically because when I think about it

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
looking at it when I think about looking directly I think actually

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
about literally looking at people and looking at paintings looking

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
at

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
art growing up with art around growing up with

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
paintings on the wall. Many of them by my great uncle who is the painter Charles

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Alston many of them which were made by my mother who was a very

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
very accomplished artist before she became a mother before she became a historian so

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.000
she

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
had many many amazing lives and so there were

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
always beautiful things to look at and to look at again and to regard with

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
care and the expectation that you would look and see something

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
different each time there was that kind of full on I think directness.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I don't know I mean all I can think of is that a certain kind of you know my as my grandmother would

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
say not raising that is cattle but rearing you know a kind

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
of expectation that as black people you

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
don't break. I contact with any body ever.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
You know. So so that very very keen sense that the

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
world is yours stand squarely in it and that that was part of kind of race

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
work and race rhetoric and that to to break that would be

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
actually the

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
shame. This is a fascinating and wonderful segue to my next.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Because one of the things

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that gets very short shrift in terms of the story of blackness.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Are the many different classes right that exist within black America and.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Daryl printing for instance is novel. Was about the black middle class and

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Midwest and your family being but middle class

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
professionals did that in certain but worlds make you

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
feel side of the world. Similarly did you feel outside

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
of certain white world at the Sidwell Friends School

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
for instance because what you're really nice about friends of the of the few

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
similarities did. Did you feel outside

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
of certain. Narratives because of

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that difference. Well my my

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
grandmother always told us she she she didn't teach us. You know

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
they were these kind of like people who teach you to be superior to other right. In

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
fact that was kind of a verboten ideology but she did teach

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
us that

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
if someone showed their racism or you know she wouldn't say show their ass.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Well you know but if they did that you were just to think of them as limited. Oh

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
isn't that a pity they are so very

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
limiting you know say you know I mean those surviving women they

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
were serious and cold

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
like that you know and then when you look for the next thing you help me with that too when I'm going

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
crazy you just look at me and said yes limits.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
That's all you need to know and you can expend too much too much energy on it she would sometimes

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
she just.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
You know put a finger on my on my forehead limited.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So that's the saying like don't don't use that brain on figuring this

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
out because you won't because racism

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
has infinite energy and fuel and irrationality so

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.000
don't give

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
it any more any. Any more power than that. And

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
so and that was so what I knew about the Sidwell Friends School

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
was that it was recently desegregated. You know so

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
it's conservatism which is how I experienced it it's changed a lot.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
It's fundamental conservatism was something that I could think about knowing that you

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
know Southern senators had successfully kept black people out of it just a few

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
years before I got there.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You know Washington when my parents moved from New York when we moved in one thousand nine hundred eighty three was a

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
very southern city still in its desegregation process. And we were quite aware of

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
that and as New

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Yorkers you know they just this was all so. So we were outside. It

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
was wonderful that they were from New York because we were outside of that foolishness and also

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
outside of a lot of the foolishness of you know black D.C. high

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Bush was exactly. You know which which they taught us was

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
foolish. Toni Morrison when she went to Howard she said she wanted to go to a

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
bloody University and she was so

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
shocked. That stuff that you're describing in terms about this was the that there

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
wasn't one community it was about a hierarchy that was very shocking and weird

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
to Yep. And I think that so that that didn't much interest my parents and my

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
parents too came from different backgrounds as well so

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
even though

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
they came from. Went to the same schools came from from Harlem they came from

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
different Harlem's with different backgrounds. So my mother's family came to Harlem

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
from Tuskegee where they were a family of educators her father was Booker T.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Washington second in command his treasure when he was building Tuskegee

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Institute and my father would look at these pictures of these fancy you know white

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
looking negroes on the porch at Tuskegee and say

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
well all those clothes are nice but where's the house where is the property. How could he well you

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
know what do you you know he was being funny but he was also sort of

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
saying we know that you have the educate. To show for it which obviously

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
he

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
revered but also there was an irony in there. Yes. What do you

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
actually have to show other than what you black people have to show for them

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
things to do other than being City. Other than having read a lot of books which again was

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
a tremendous value

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
but you know there. There's a kind of a practicality that he had that

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I found always that that was a very interesting conversation and he would you know kind of

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
again embellish it Harlem story tell us they were there with your mother up on Sugar Hill. You know

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and here we

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
were down below their

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
drama but I

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
think that the nuances and this is where you start the nuances

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
and the beauty and the contours and the and the and the

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
gorgeous differences in black when I think it's thank you keep each other and to write it

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
all the time. Yeah yeah. You

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
said I read an interview recently it was an old when we used said

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
that politics was chess part of the family. It was part of

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
the conversation. Tell me how that worked. You were brought

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
to today's march on Washington as a baby so.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
It's been in your ear for your whole life talking about how it worked in the family.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Well what if they go to D.C. by the way. So

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
he went to Washington D.C. Having worked first at an organization here.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
He was an assistant

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
district attorney in New York City after graduating law school. He served in the in the Army

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
as a private he worked for an organization called hard you act a Harlem

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
community organization and then he came at the behest of President Kennedy to

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
work for a moment for the National Security

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Council and then when President Kennedy was killed he became one

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
of Lyndon Johnson's White House lawyers and one of three people

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
who were working in the White House Office on civil rights so he was the

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
liaison to the people out. Side in the civil rights movement so you know all

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
of those meetings that the white man set up in Selma my dad set up.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Which is just saying not to say anything about the movie but to say like a thirty one year old

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
black man. I start to

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
imagine that in the yard we have imagine.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
You know was was doing that work and in a way not thinking nothing of it thinking

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
everything of it but stepping to the moment rising to the occasion

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
and always understanding that

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
his seemingly rarefied position was in service to what he always

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
on ambiguously understood as his people and our forward

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
movement so that was just the way people were but you know it was

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
also even in hearing about you know Tuskegee Yeah I mean I remember in college reading up from slavery from

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
the first time at the you know I

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
hate book he was. He still can say I got up by the

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
bucket but I didn't like any of that stuff but thinking about it from another

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
angle you know what did it mean for people born into slavery.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
To be thinking in any way about the education

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
of newly

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
emancipated people. Well here's a complex an interesting point about your father was that the self

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
was not his old country. The Caribbean was his old country so how was

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
he relating

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
to blacks this was just blackness to him it didn't

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
matter geography didn't matter or what was his feeling about coming

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
from the west and the culture

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Well yeah it's interesting so he spent all his years in Harlem but his father came from

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Jamaica came to Harlem in one thousand nine hundred eighteen and my my grandmother

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
his mother was from North Carolina then Yonkers then Harlem and so I think part of what's

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
important about that is that you know global

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
blackness was not invented yesterday. Right right. You know

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
as nor was the black inland. You know no were you know I mean we've been across. Sitting

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
and talking

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
to each other and you know to quote as I always do Gwendolyn Brooks on this we are everywhere.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
You know we occur everywhere and that's an old thing. So I think that part of what's really

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
fascinating about the history of New York City in particular and the history of Harlem in

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
particular is that there

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
was already that kind of and I don't mean to romanticize it

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
or flatten differences but there was an umbrella of blackness under which

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
many many many different kinds of people took shelter

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
and worked and worked

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
together and he I mean to give more

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
due to your father to give your kids that legacy is profound in

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
a country when most people don't know past their

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
grandparents what their world was let alone who their people were so when you walk into.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
One of the things that I notice is that you face it squarely too.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
That's a great heritage of your parents is not only their history.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000
But the ways in which history can reinforce our very being in the world now.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
So I want to thank you.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I wanted you to read something very

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
beautiful because Elizabeth on top of everything else is an

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
amazing performer and I'm going to bust her on that in a minute but from

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
your book. Miss Crandall's school of young for young ladies and little misses of color which is

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
a great title and a great book it was published in two thousand and seven and when I think of

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
little Lizzie I think of the first which is called knowledge would you mind reading it.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
OK And so this.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
The poet Marilyn Nelson when she was. Poet Laureate of the state of

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Connecticut decided that what she wanted to do the project of that poet laureate ship was going to

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
be to explore in poetry and turn resources to a. Boring and

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
creating poetry about the history of black people in Connecticut which history of black people in Connecticut.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
A topic

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
do we know a lot about that not a whole lot.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And so she invited me she had been writing

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
poetry. That was delayed response like

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
well I'll try to make that happen a few

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
more things here but so she invited

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
me she started writing poems for young adults and she

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
said let's do a project together you write you know historical poems I write

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
historical poems. We were both obsessed with prudence Crandell a white Quaker woman who

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
started

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
school first for any young girls

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
in Canterbury Connecticut and then when the

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
townspeople there was a black girl who worked at the school

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
and said If I perform my chores.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
May I stay in the back of the room and study with the other girls and prudence Crandall

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
said yes and the townspeople

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
objected and then she said well and they continue to object she said Well then

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
your girls the white girls can go home and I'll run Miss Crandell school for young ladies Little Misses of

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
color which she did but the townspeople so opposed

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
her so fought her poisoned their water source killed the

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
cat in tied it to the front of the you know so prevented her from

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.000
teaching

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
eventually set the school on fire. And so that is

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
her story and we thought about who was this

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
woman and who was this woman who met her moment who didn't set

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
out to be this kind of a rebel what was and who

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:54.000
were these young women who so desperately wanted to become educated. So.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Knowledge. It wasn't as if it

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
wasn't as if we knew nothing before. After all colored girls must know

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
many things in order to survive.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Not only could I sew buttons and hands but I could make a dress and pantaloons

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
from scratch. I could milk cows churn butter feed

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
chickens clean their coops wring their necks pluck and cook them.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
I cut wood set fires and boiled water to wash the clothes and

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
sheets then rung them dry and I could read the

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Bible evenings before the fire. My family tired from an

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
ending work and New England cold. They'd

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
close their eyes. My favorite was Song of Songs.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
They most like when I read in the beginning.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And of course she's the one in it with her family the only one who can read. And so that's

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
what she has for them that's what she gives for

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
them and you know what I love about it is the humility that one

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
can find and try it when you're a deeply humble

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
person you don't have to be speak of your pride you can just

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
do it and that's one of the things I love about you and your word. Thank you

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
so I want you to read.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
You know I want to read one more use Linux sequence because.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
This was a poem you know one of the things about let me sing for you know.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
So I'm carrying and holding this Mike because I was too vain to take off my beautiful

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
airings and they were quacking on the

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
microphone. Thank you so thank you we can do

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.000
many

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
things at once. So one of the things that I think

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
is so interesting about writing historical poems and about writing in persona is and it's a

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
wonderful writing trick. I don't teach. Poetry

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
as much as I used to but a great writing trick is to ask students to choose a

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
historical persona someone they're obsessed with and write in the voice of that person. And inevitably

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
the magic trick at the end is that you find that if you've been successful

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
you learn something about yourself that perhaps you might not have been able to say

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
directly because you're behind

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
metaphor because you're behind many more and the high persona. Yeah but you're writing out of obsession.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
So so this is a poem called Allegiance again in the voice of

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.000
one of

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
these girls. And it's eighteen thirty about in these

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
poems and they're all

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
sonnets teacher is be willed or when packages and

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
letters come from far to say how brave how

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
visionary how stare down the beast is Prudence

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Crandell of Canterbury. Work. She says there is

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
always work to do not in the name of self but in the name

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
the water clarity of what is right. We Crave

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Radiance in this austere world light in the spiritual darkness.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Learning is the one perfect religion its path correct

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
narrow certain

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
straight at its end it blossoms and billows into

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
very colored polyphony the sweet infinity of true

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
knowledge. And so when I would start reading from

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
that and imagining these young girls who travelled so far and

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
of course you know what was travel in eight hundred thirty How did you

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
get from Lynchburg Virginia to Canterbury Connecticut in eight hundred thirty How did your

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
parents send you there how did your parents say goodbye to you. I would

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
think as I read and would feel more and more fervor in my body as I read that poem I would

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
think I believe that yes I believe

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
that you believe also something that is remarkable

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
for most writers are interested in truth in

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
their nihilism.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Right. Twentieth century poets have an interest in nihilism

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
that the world begins and ends with their words one of the things

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
that's continually continuous Is that your work is a continual

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
one gesture poetic is to me leading

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
into the prose gesture or dramatic gesture and I'm

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
wondering about the power of different genres

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
for you when you're writing decision would dictate or do

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
you dictate how you are going to

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
say well I've had a very very interesting test of that with this memoir with the light of

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
the world and since it's a

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
memoir and I am more known for writing poetry I've just been on this book tour

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
and people ask me what have you what else what are you working on now you

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
know they like.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Please please know what. Like I said right now I think I'm working on right now.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Oh yeah that's right.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
I mean it's a reasonable question but you know but also you know that

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
the sort of you know arguments and are

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
you writing this are you writing the statistics actually back to

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
me

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
but you know are you writing poems do you still write. Do you still write poems

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
and so to a few of my poet friends I've sort of you know dramatically taken to the fainting couch

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
and said I will never write poems I no longer write poems.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
You know never

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
again and that you know that is dramatic but what is true is

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
that writing this book showed me very very keenly

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
that sometimes you know though I

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
as a professor and a scholar I'm incredibly interested in general I'm interested

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
in wrote a whole dissertation on collage in Highbridge honor as you know black women's creativity.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I think that the properties of genres are very very marginal are very

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
very important I think that that young. Writers need to

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
understand

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
what they are writing in to and against both historically and

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
also formally these is very very very important but right now what I'm

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
feeling is that to police those borders to avidly is

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
sometimes fundamentally anti creative. Yes and that you

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.000
know

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
if to discover that I can feel a

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
word and then a phrase and then some music coming up out of my visceral in

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
the way that it does in poetry but that then builds into something that

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
is prose but its own kind of prose is is absent.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Was

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
thrilling and it made me feel that I

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
could make so much more it made me feel that I could keep working.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
It made me feel that I was a real artist more than I ever felt that in my whole life.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
So I feel that I have to honor the fact that John Roe

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
was broken.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Yes you know because it made something

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
else for your role as broken right. Your

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
persona

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
was cracked. Yes in the most essential. Way it's like a

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
vase and something cracks and things still keep growing out of the.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
That's right right that's beautiful that's exactly right thank you yes and so one of the

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
things that one of the things that I think is I'm just going when I was

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
preparing today. I was going back in my mind

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
to amazing moments watching you we stand up

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
for poetry now when you started the Poetry Center at Smith College this is your

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.000
first

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
job Smith I know my first so my first job was at the University of Chicago Chicago

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
my first first job was a year at Haverford College and then Assistant Professor ship at

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
the university. And then to mess with them

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
and and then Smith was after that after I ran away and joined the circus

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
and fell in love and started having babies. I left Chicago and was

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
the Conkling poet in residence and you were a Conklin writer there as

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
well and and the the amazing Ruth Simmons was the president

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
at the time and she

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
had said to the entire campus and by the way she very pointedly said and to the

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
entire campus I mean the people who were cooking in the kitchens. I mean the

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
professors I mean the administrators I mean the sound people who you know make our

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
guests voices audible. I mean everybody. What are your dreams for this

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
campus dream your dreams and write them and send them to me and we'll see what we can

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
do and that's how the engineering program was born it's mis read an

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
extraordinary one and that's how the Poetry Center was born as it happened. The moment that

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
I arrived there. That was blossoming and they said to me would you want to run

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
this Poetry Center.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Well here's a song about that we both enjoyed our time immensely and one

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
of the things that was very hard to do walking down Queen Street

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
was not to tear up when I saw the engineering building

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
because he says girls can't do math right that's right and

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I often wanted my classes to be in the engineering building just inspired.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
The fact the architecture of language was my whole point. But

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.000
anyway

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
so

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
one of the things that was powerful to me when I was going to the Poetry Center was to think

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
about the ways in which your family

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
activism you had translated that to the academics.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Making them to yell so powerful and huge when you were

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
running at starting the Poetry Center it's a mess. I D's.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I want to call them. Sort of righteous activities. Is this part of

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
your D.N.A. as well.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Well it's interesting you know I've been thinking about all of those kinds of things even at Haverford. You know

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
always you know some of it

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
is always willing to put on a show and loving putting on a show

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
and being really bossy. And you know really and just

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
loving extravaganza and loving getting everyone excited and going to the barn and you saying let's

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
go let's know come on this is great but also I've realized. Seriously

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I swear to

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
God It is about redistributing wealth and getting into artists and people of color and women.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
And that is a through line all the way even from in college.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
I would find what little money was there and turn it to you know ritual of descent

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
this incredible Journal that some of us made of African-American Arts and Letters.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
I'm always finding the money asking the money hand in hand raising the money

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
and making something happen that wasn't supposed to happen in that space.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
You know but that needed to happen in that space. Or that needed to happen more fulsomely in that

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
space making sure always that artists were paid and paid properly.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
I mean you know to the best of my ability. It seems like a little thing but it's but having

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.000
done it now

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
for thirty years. It's very very important. I work at

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
a zillion Arish University. You know if there's so much

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
money black folks and colored folks and women and

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
poets ought to have some of that money because we're dead without the work they don't there's

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
nothing without that you know we were when you were big if you know that's

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
right that's right and I mean also as a friend of mine says about getting paid she said next

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
time you're not getting paid just look out and the person who made the ice sculpture

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
got paid. That's right you know. And right in the person who's pouring the drinks

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.000
is getting

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
paid you know everybody's getting paid so. So the artists need to get paid

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
and institutions I think that have resources. I think it

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
is a joy when those resources come to flow in the survey.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
The life force of

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
our energy visible evidence. This is capital so they want to see what's going

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
to happen. If they give you that twenty five dollars What can you do with it. Here's

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
another seventy because you did this.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Let me know how to do. Hello.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So here's my statement was that when you did a reading.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
It's a two

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
pronged question stating that Helen Vendler wrote an essay

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
about and psychology of poetry

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
that came under a lot of discussion let's say because she was saying that there

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
was not really enough black poetry to make an anthology that's one of

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
her criticisms that second part of that

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
was when I saw you in the waiting

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
room. And there was you were there but you didn't feel the

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
same way that this Elizabeth felt about looking at these black women National Geographic was

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.000
one of the

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
profound performances where was that was that Smith No no you were doing it

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
with frankly doing a bunch of other people dream and. I was at a.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Yes yes yes

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
and I was there. And it was one of the greatest performances I've ever

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
seen and so I wanted to talk about this idea of

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
the black from that. In poetry.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And also a little bit of the ship and I'd like to talk to you about it.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Yes I love Elizabeth Bishop. She's she's one of my favorite

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
poets and I think one of the interesting thing about living with certain

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
poems over time and revisiting them and going back and

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
understanding or being interested in different things as

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
as your own life changes is that great poetry will continue to

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
reveal those different things to you and allow you to have. Like I have a real

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
relationship with this poem. Because when I first. Read it my

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
grandmother who didn't didn't she didn't read it a lot of modern

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
poetry but she had a copy of Elizabeth the ship's Geography three. That

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
was one of em when I She had a beautiful little perfect bookshelf and her little beautiful

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
tiny studio apartment near the United Nations and when I would go and visit her which I did

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
often I would read her books over and over again and this Elizabeth Bishop was one of the books she had I'm not quite

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
sure why you know she had counted CULLEN You know shit classic

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
black poetry. She had Shakespeare but you have this Elizabeth Bishop and so the part that

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
you mention I remember as a child

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
being

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
compelled and a little embarrassed and fascinated and not

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
having words for what I was feeling and then different points revisiting the poem I had

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
more words and I think also maybe it's important to talk

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
about the part of an artist that is. She your ego.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
You know of of just following language that overrides all language you've ever made

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
before and about reading other poems and wanting

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
to say those words as though you wrote them to take them in your body that way

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
and so the sheer ego part of me

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
loved reading a line that you'll know when I come to it you know. So in the

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
right in the waiting room.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
It's given room for.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
OK. Yeah

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
OK in western Massachusetts.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I went with with Aunt Constance hello to keep her dentist

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
appointment and sat and waited for her in the dentist's waiting room. It was winter

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
it got dark early the waiting room was full of grown up people arctics

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
and overcoats lamps and magazines.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
My aunt was inside what seemed like a long time and while I waited I read the

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
National Geographic I could read and carefully studied the

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
photographs the inside of. Volcano black and full of ashes.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Then it was spilling over in reveal it's a

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
fire OSA and Martin Johnson dressed in riding

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
breeches laced boot boots and his

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
helmets a dead man slung on a pole Long Pig The

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
caption said babies with pointed heads well and round and round with

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
string black naked women with necks wound round and round

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
with wire like the necks of

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
lightbulbs their breasts were horrifying. I read it right straight

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
through I was too shy to stop and then I looked at the

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
cover the yellow margins the

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
date suddenly from inside came and. Of pain on

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
console way Loz voice not very loud or long I wasn't at all

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
surprised even then I knew she was a foolish timid

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
woman I might have been embarrassed but wasn't what took me completely by

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
surprise was that it

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
was me my voice in my

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
mouth without thinking at all I we

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
were falling

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
falling our eyes glued to the cover of the National Geographic

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
February one thousand nine hundred

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
eighteen I said to myself three days and you'll be seven years

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
old I was saying to stop the sensation of falling off

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
the round turning world in cold

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
blue black space but I felt you are and

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
I you are and Elizabeth you are one of them.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Why should you be one too and the poem goes on from there.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
So you know just sort of you know what to make of of

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
of her Harrer is that a racialized horror. You know we get the word black before we

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
come to the black people. The black in the volcano and you know something's about to

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
happen and then

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
her horror at these images in. Geographic But is it a racialized

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
car is it the kind of voyeuristic horror of

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
a

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
child who can't turn away and trying to sort of think

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
about that. And the satisfaction even as a young girl even in

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
that discomfort which

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
I knew there was something that wasn't quite right of being able to then speak the

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
line and to see it in a poem I know meant something

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.000
to me.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
There is something

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
very tender and with that in your book poem

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
possibility which I hope you take up it's a wonderful book. And the

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.000
first one is

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
about a poet that mattered a

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
great deal to me as a young person poem and stunned.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
And I used to try

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
to dress like parliaments and read to my mother

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000
as if I'd written the Proms. And it was another love Paul line.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.000
And

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
so I want to this is this is a wonderful occasion

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
to read the first couple of paragraphs from Elizabeth's essay

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
called Dunbar lives which if

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
you know anything about you is a reference to bird lives in

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
the course of writing this essay I found something that surprised.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Dunbar and that is for a much to contemporary African-American poet and I've also discovered

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
have done by matters to me several years ago in conversation with

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
another African-American poet.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
I mentioned that when I was growing up my father would occasionally recite parliament says

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Dunbar's the party. He did so joyfully and apropos of nothing but exuberance as

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
far as my brother and I could

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
tell this was always a thrill. He had slipped into the

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
vernacular as we

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
said for now if you are always having the articles. And once movements from another

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
time the speech just said.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I was describing described as. Slipping. I think actually that noticing

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
and leveling the shifts and direction.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
What made me a poet growing up around my mother Sugar Hill Harlem Queen's

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000
English my grandfather's Jamaican music and vocabulary use a figurative language.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
My grandmother saw strong that Alabama flowers

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
mix was was a chance to turn synthetic starch shaped by

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
her teachers and one hundred twenty S. parlance Laurence Dunbar High School in

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Washington D.C. Now this is something that you come to again and again

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
especially in your discussions further with Sterling Brown and Gwendolyn Brooks and it's

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
just it's just really this sort of amazing amalgamation

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
of different sounds that come out through the sensibility of you

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
or sterling or whomever but one of the things

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
that interested me in terms of your development

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
was when was it clear to you that's a music was something that

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
was feeding you as well

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
because we certainly enlistments read very

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
brilliantly at the Village Vanguard you with your Stravinsky.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And and I'm wondering was it because you were a dancer.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
First I think that.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
You know I always just took music sort of for granted. I mean it was it was ambient

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
my parents had records my parents had dance parties that was love when they had dance parties

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
and my brother and I would watch and see what was going on from

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
behind closed doors and that was another kind of slip. You know like these

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
very you know pulled together. You know race people by

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
day and then you know just getting down by night. You loved watching that

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
that transformation. I still love I love those moments you know like oh well

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
there she got it right there.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
She put it away.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
But I think that's a very of there a very beautiful and mighty kind of a.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Oppressive power. Yeah and you know how I mean the great traditions of

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
black music right I mean

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
how you know from jazz there was a I've talked about this great D.J. and Washington

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
named Felix Grant who had a show and of email and that began at nine

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
o'clock every night I would listen to when I was doing my homework on my little transistor

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
radio and it was a very

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
kind of old fashioned wonderful educational jazz show you know

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
not quite like the Leonard Bernstein Peter in the wool for the you know the concerts for young people it

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
wasn't that kind of Dinosauria not didactic but I learned so

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
much listening to that there was always there was always

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
music that was where my first little bit of money would go you know when there were the you know fifty

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Cent record been forty and they have a little hole punch in the corner and you could.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
You could you could buy them so music was just very very important and I think that certainly yes you

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
know growing

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
up studying dance very seriously being very devoted to

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
that I think that that was classical music which

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:05.000
I

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
don't really know except through dance but I think the understanding

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
that you're trying to make your body move

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
in relationship to this music and that music gives you structure and form

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
is certainly something that came forward into the making of poems.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000
When you were in college and going through college and grad school and.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
One point in your budget for you worked as a newspaper person but it didn't

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
speak journalism didn't speak to you as a writer he said defensively.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Why don't you tell us why. And it wasn't that it spoke to me greatly as a

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
writer I and I love. Journalists and their mission their

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
knowledge and their service to the ranger she's back

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
there

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
anything that's I mean I really did I I love I love journalists and when I.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Little

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
period working as a journalist I felt that it made me much braver you know it gave me

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000
a reason to go talk to people that I didn't know and to explore the city where I grew up but

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
to places where I hadn't been because they'd send me to you know Lorton reformatory to write a story about something

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
that was happening there they'd send me to you know wherever I

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
went I went and I had a reason to be there and so I couldn't be shy

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
and that was a really really great thing but what I realized was that it mean it's really true

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
I felt the will to

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
embellish I felt that I could see the line and this is very serious business

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000
because it was The Washington Post sure I arrived shortly after Janet Cooke

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
unceremoniously left and this is an amazing story of a black woman

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
journalist who made up a whole story about you know. Eight year old who was on that arrow and so

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
forth and it turned out and this. I don't know maybe I need to write about that one day because this is

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000
still one of the most stomach churning dramatic tales of an aggressive today I have

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.000
ever

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
heard of you know right up to you know the say resume and when the story falls apart

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
then on her resume it says that she speaks French and then Bradley comes up to her in the newsroom and says.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
But if it's a bunch of it's also. And she can't answer because she doesn't speak French but she's

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
put it on her resume that she does like

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.000
this part in the NEWSROOM he unravels her but she's unraveled herself.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Lord have mercy.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000
So let's call that So in the space of that's right and you know. And

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
also that all

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
the black editors and reporters at the newspaper always knew she was

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
lying yes. And they told the white

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
people or they didn't tell the white people because they didn't want to bust her it's

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
right because they knew that the story made no sense that's right. And they knew that

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
the corner she described did not exist. That's right.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.000
So then the story also on Ravel says you know the editors say OK take us

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
there and she can't.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
So I digress but it's just to say that. That was the climate. You

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
know mendacious black women you know who was was sort

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
of in the air and when I started feeling that there

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
were you know like here's what was

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
true but I was interested in what was kind of right over here. That that

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
actually did tell me that I wanted to be a different kind of writer but I feel so

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
grateful even just for a journalist relationship to time you go from journalism to the Academy

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
where nothing's ever really do and shame is the motivator because you

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000
said as opposed to like you don't get in by five and you're not in the paper and maybe you don't have a job a next

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
day I love I love that I think that's just a wonderful

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
thing and sometimes I pretend it's true. Yes I need to get things done but you'll

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000
be fired. What are

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000
the one of the things that I loved about your relationship to

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
the stories over there

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
was a selling feature of your play

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
writing and it's something that I've always been pushing you to go back

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
to but it was one of the things that

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
feel so in love with. So let's talk about

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
that aspect of your life as a

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000
lover and how that says a word and also what that life

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000
is yes well you know I love Look where we are

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
OK

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000
yeah. And but more importantly it's not just the Africa and then we're about to talk about

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
my late and beautiful Eritrean

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
husband but I mean that's how he painted our children. You know like little Perseus like

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000
yeah beautiful to see just like just like that with very knowing faces.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000
But with kind of east African Coptic iconography in the eyes and so

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000
forth so I feel that we're actually kind of in exactly the right space yeah.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
So you know the

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
discovery and a disco around that was me not.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Skipped over the

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
disco. But you know what can I say I mean I was

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
lucky enough to have a partner who believed in me as no one ever has or will

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
you know and who loved that I mean as I wrote in the light

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
of the world.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000
I love that she was an artist I love she was a teacher I love that she had short hair. And

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
that we instantly went on with it and made our life together after

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
one week after you know he saw my play his first words to me which

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
are you know they're it's funny now when again you know we seem to have this theme

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
of you know the kind

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
of you know he's like oh I loved your play. Could we talk about it

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.000
why

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
certainly my

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
work when I sit down and I'll sleep with

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
you but then I never left so it was

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
OK OK That's OK.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
But you know but but to just just to say to say

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
yes to well my situation. It wasn't a situation. Oh no

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
it wasn't that I don't again I was in that kind Exactly and it was rationed. But you know

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
to to be fortunate enough to find. A soulmate and again

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
I think the important thing to young people in the room is is that

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
really seriously is the saying yes. You

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
know seriously that's very

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
emotional. Yeah. And just saying like I'm going to do this I'm going to do

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
this I'm going to leave my job. I'm going to let this person come

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.000
and pick me up in

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000
the car and take me halfway across the country and I'm a start having babies and he will

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
not let me star and I will get a

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000
job because that's how I made and that's how I was raised and we will be

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
fine and we were.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
And the power in the beauty was that you know to each other

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
he you know an amazing brilliant person who came as a refugee

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
from Eritrea first walked out of the country it's. Sixteen to

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Sudan went to Italy went to Germany landed in the United States worked as an

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
activist then worked in a million kitchens been made a restaurant with his

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000
brothers for sixteen years then really devoted himself to painting that devoting himself

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000
to painting he had always painted but I was the one who

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
said really let's do this really let's do this

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.000
and

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
now to get to be to be artist together.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Well you know but to him to say like I see it but it was it was collective because you know we had

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
to we had to make conditions for each of us to make our work. So if

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
that men were you know finding a

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
place where he could you know turn the garage in the back into a studio or if that meant

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
you know that he would take the kids on an adventure while I would get my writing

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
done or that we would take the time as we did to always be

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
each other's usually only critic he was my only the only person whom I ever showed

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000
my work never ever ever ever. And he would always tell me what he thought

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
very very honestly as I did with every single line he ever made so

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.000
that kind of one

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
of the things that is so brilliant really describes the many

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
languages of languages he spoke so it was almost as if you had a built in

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000
translator for what you were working through as an artist that was someone who could hear

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.000
languages that maybe weren't even on the page you know and that's so

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
interesting that's what I thought when I read we read the book I said Triqui was an

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
amazing translator as well translator of your poetic soul.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
That's really amazing because you know he so he had a gift for languages

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
but I mean it wasn't it was also forged out of necessity through

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000
brutal colonial occupation and relocation. He didn't just say you know you

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000
must get to speak English well that's exactly right you know he didn't you

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
know aspire

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
to study German he learned German because. As he ended up

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
there and had to figure out a way to go to school he didn't know word. And

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.000
in nine

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
months he was successfully going to school in German you know having his

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
and that's just one of the many you know these are languages that aren't even like each other German

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
is not like. Arabic is not like it's not like Spanish is not

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
like you know Italian I mean there are relationships but but but so

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
so he was a gifted child but also history demanded these things of him

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
to survive. You know and the bounty of that you know once he was

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
safe and once we were in one place and building a life together was

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
indeed someone

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
who knew so many things and had so many words and so

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
many sounds and we would we would talk about what were the things that

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
we had we had so much in common even though our lives were seemingly very different and

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000
started halfway around the world and we would talk about it was interesting we discovered we.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Growing up and the book talks about this a lot.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
How do people born halfway around the world find their way to each other and make a life together. Well

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
it happens every day it actually happens every day.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Well I have only one slight objection to

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
what you said and it's only because I

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
feel so

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
much love for you just reading

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
everything and the person that emerges is someone

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
who

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
was perfectly true but had yet to hear the

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
notes of the person and so when he spoke in your book

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
you talk

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
about your body really I don't think that that's just for young people. I think

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
that when we stay open to the possibility of love and

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
connection that weird relaxation happens to us.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Wow And so you know I feel like talking to you.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It doesn't it doesn't it doesn't mean

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
anything in terms of the being part of what makes

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
the next level accessible. I think it has everything to do

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
with what we do where we put our bodies in the line of fire and

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
you put your body there and he did too and one of the

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
beautiful parts of this is the

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
relentless drive and you let him drive the car.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Everyone has to have one person in this life. The absolute truth.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
When they say you know I was at work and I told this film and I didn't

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
do you know that

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
person but I didn't call

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
my mother back and she and I said I left a message and I didn't do that all of the

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
stuff that makes us feel morally compromised.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
You have to have one person. That you feel that you will go crazy.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And so the power of the book. Is that you're

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
not just telling. That in life that you were sharing but

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
you're telling it and so do. And so doing that you're telling it to the rest

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
of thank you you know I mean you

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
know that's thank you and I think I

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
don't think you will ever stop having that it's.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Well you know one of the things that's been really interesting and

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I say interesting because you know with books of poems people meet

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the poems in all kinds of ways for all kinds of really interesting

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
reason but there are a lot of people who come to this particular book because it's

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
memoir because of the story. But it's not just because they feel like

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
that happened. It's

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
because something else happened to them that feels resonant. And that

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
they want to share and so that's been really interesting but but I've also

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
been learning this is to your point

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
about. Kind of what happened to make

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
this book.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
You know and I've been thinking about you know you cite the passage where.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I describe myself as a backseat driver and you know. There's so many revelations.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
But then I finally relax and then you know recall at

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
the end of that I open. I open my eyes and I hear his

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
voice and he says and this is after we've known each other for a month he said

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Lizzie calls me Lizzie has never called me Lizzy before. And

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
he says and that's my intimate name from my niece and nephews. He says

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Lizzie you have land in Africa. And I feel

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
like I

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
just for witness to some things in this book

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and you know because organ when I describe you know going with when

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
my son Simon at the age of twelve says Do you want to come to visit Daddy with me

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
in heaven. Yes you know and I'll take you there.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I feel like I mean yes you know craft.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Absolutely there's a tremendous tremendous you know blood soaked sweat stained

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
craft in here and I'm very proud of that but I also feel like there's a bearing witness

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
to life and its power and its beauty and its terror we were

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
talking earlier about you know there's the real quote in the book that so meaningful to me let everything happen

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000
to you Beauty and Terror and then it continues no feeling is final.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And so I feel that that's kind of what happened here.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Exactly it's sort of like when you're watching a film and you're looking at

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
the corners of the film and you know that there's

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
life being framed. But it's there

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and that's pretty permeating and making the image so this is.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
It's not just. You see but what's around and aura of the

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and or of your writings. Has something to do

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
with lace that will continue past the age.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
A lot of what I meant by nihilism the poetry twentieth century poetry was that the world

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
begins and ends with it and a lot of twentieth century and twenty first century.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It's one of the things and poetry encompasses all of your work.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
One of the things that is extraordinary about all of your

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
work is that it continues past the page in

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
my mind you can go. You can visit to

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
take your writing and then your mind will go somewhere else

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
because that was the passport to go somewhere else.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
And that I think the one of the pleasure you know I mean of

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
course writing it is not pleasurable and profoundly pleasurable. You know I

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
mean actually doing it it's so hard isn't even the word what is the word for

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
what we what

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
we do when we labor to make

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
it but then something similar

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
but then when you turn the corner there's no ideal and. There's no

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
better feeling when you can make

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
shape from all the muck and that to me that that the

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
joy of the experience of kind of following you talk about the passport.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
You know following this to this to this read a little bit.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Well I'm just desperate to have you do that and I just wanna say one other thing to

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
that point was that one of the things that I love about the book and

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
all of you writing I really want to stress people. You've got to read the whole

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
schmear there's a great Marshall essay called The poets in the

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
kitchen and she talks about the West Indian women sitting around the table

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and discussing life. And what you were talking about past

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
the aspect of it really is the voice of the

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
book. To be

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
a literary convention.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And it's free in that way that conversation and the soul is free to me

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
is really. Wow Did you

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
have you know what I love they would like to part of just

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
a list of the things that you have to do over you know when that's from children.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Yes yes. Is that is that a good

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
thing that is good. OK. Yes

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:46.000
please

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
take but I mean.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.000
If

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.000
you

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000
don't that's OK so we would have loved you

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.000
know we had fifteen Christmases

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
together almost fifteen years of marriage sixteen

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
years together one thousand nine hundred six to two thousand and twelve we always said it felt longer than it

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
was I would estimate at the end that we had a twenty five year marriage and secret I

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.000
would agree

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
that long that much struggle that much do you believe in

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
fishes one Easter faecal I found a sheep farmer in Cheshire Connecticut and had

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
a lamb slaughtered for his sister to do for her said hey they're rich and spicy

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Eritrean meat stew and her roast we found where we could buy Italian Easter

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
bread shaped in across with a hard boiled egg baked in one pass quite he'd say and so would

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I three trips to Italy where we had family in which was our

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
ironic colonial Demi motherland. Each time to different places Rome

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Venice Florence a mouthy yes but also body. Julia set out to see in-laws

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and friends London Scotland Spain Oakland the diaspora of our

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000
family Milan awaited and bellicose Ghana and Naples. Once the crime

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
settled down and Cecilia he wanted to smell the mint crushed

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
underfoot the Alhambra awaited and the orange blossoms in southern

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Spain in very early spring

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
time.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And then.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
We loved Jimmy Scott's version of The David Byrne song have. And heaven

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000
is a place where nothing ever

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
happens these days I picture heaven populated by the ember and

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
jewels faecal I painted in abundance but that seems too fanciful

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I never truly believed in heaven and cannot manufacture it Little Jimmy Scott's

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
plaintiveness seems right when he sings nothing ever

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
happens how better to describe the infinite solitude of the afterlife.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
When this kiss is over it will start again it will not be any different it will be exactly the

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
same he sings each kiss is fixed it is the same long kiss but

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
it will never change that is the comfort and that is the heart

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
break one night at bedtime Simon asks if I want to come with him

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.000
to visit seek a day in heaven. Yes I say and lie down on his bed.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
First you close your eyes he says and ride the clear glass

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
elevator up we go. What do you see I

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
ask God is sitting at the gates he answers.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
What does God look like I ask like God. Mommy. He

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
says. Now we go to where daddy is he has

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
two rooms. Simon says one room with a single bed and his books and another where he

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
paints the painting room is vast he can look out any window he wants and

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
paint that room has four views our backyard. The doc you painted in

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Maine as Mara and New Mexico New Mexico.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I ask. Yes Simon says the volcano crater with the magic grass.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I guess I say the call data where we saw the gophers and the jack rabbits

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and the elk running across and daddy called it the

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
veldt Yes. Do you see it and I do see

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
it the light is perfect for painting his bed in

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Heaven is a sea. Engel bed.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
OK it's time to go now Simon says so down we go. You can come with

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
me anytime he says Thank you my darling I don't think you

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:17.000
can find it by yourself yet he says but one day you will.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Thank you

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Lou Lou.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Really. I think

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
you.
