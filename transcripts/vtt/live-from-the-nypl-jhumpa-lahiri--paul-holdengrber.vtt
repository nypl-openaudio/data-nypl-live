the season with Jhumpa Lahiri back from for the second time live from the New

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
York Public Library the last time she was here with the mirror and. I had to look up when

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that was it was on March tenth two thousand and seven nine years

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ago. When they spoke about the adaptation of The Namesake.

Just as it had come out the also of the interpreter of Maladies a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.000
In other

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
words written in Italian and translated into English by

and Goldstein an editor at The New Yorker and translator among

others of a lot Elin Frank and Prima Levy.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
As you know for the last seven or eight years I've asked all of my guests to provide me

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a biography of themselves in seven words a haiku of sorts so if you're very modern to tweet.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
usually proclaim them seven words but I will withhold the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
pleasure for a while and we will regale you with those seven words

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which Drupal here you wrote in Italian towards the end of our conversation.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now it is my great

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
privilege and pleasure. To bring Jhumpa Lahiri to this stage.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Thank you

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Lou

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Thank you.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I'd like to Brit. Begin by speaking about midlife crisis

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
of.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Tony

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
job in a fantastic essay called midlife

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
crisis in the memory chalet has a following to say bear with me

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
it will take about a minute.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Other men change why it's. Some change

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
cause some. Change gender the point of the midlife crisis is

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to demonstrate continuity with one's use by doing something strikingly

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
different to be sure different is a relative term a

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
man in the throes of such a crisis usually does the same as every other

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
man that after all is how we

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
know it's a midlife crisis but mine was a little different.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I was the right age at the right time divorcing wife number

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
two and experiencing the usual mid middle age

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and certainties.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
What is all this about but I did it my

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
way I look and check.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Earning check made

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
me a very different sort of scholar historian and Perth.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Would have made me a significant difference. Had I taken up say a

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
polish my friends certainly saw

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
though to then check with a small slab

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
language much as Russian colleagues would later describe Polish and I

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
had inexplicably opted to specialize in what for them was

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the equivalent of the history of say the way he

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is but without my Czech obsession I would not have found myself in power.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
In November one thousand nine hundred eighty nine watching have L. accept the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
presidency from a balcony in the town square. Above all or

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I could never have written post-war my history of Europe since one thousand nine hundred

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
forty five my chick adventures did not get to me and new

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
wife until much later and only indirectly much less a new

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
car but they were the

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
best mid life crisis. I could have wished

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
for there were more things in heaven and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is than with Grant of in Western philosophy. And I

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
had belatedly

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
see some of them. Jhumpa Lahiri Does that

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
sound familiar.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Yes Extremely in fact i've of I thought over in recent years that I am.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
This is what's happening that it has been a sort of wonderful midlife crisis.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
You know the best kind I think you know to have a

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
relationship with the

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
language and the fear with the language.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Well and every nation ship that has so

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
many different. There's so many different ways to look at

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
it you know and I I explore this a little in the book I

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
mean thinking of it first in strictly romantic terms

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and then and

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
then feeling a sort of maternal.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Relationship too to the language that's an interesting That was an interesting shift.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
You know.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And so I so I reckon I see myself in

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that in that passage very much you know and and I think

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
that in a sense.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Language is the most intimate relationship out of our lives at least I think for

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
me I mean and this is not to say that I don't love

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
deeply people and have profound relationships with them

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
but I think language

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
is it so much more powerful than we are you know.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And so to have a relationship with languages is a very profound

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
thing and to go to goes to

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to speak another language I think is is so

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
powerful it's so

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
humbling this trial and some

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
way with it the way. A For you to shake yourself

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
up. I mean it feels when I read. Toni Judd it felt

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
to me that his mid-life crisis is running track was something he needed.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Well it certainly was a need it comes from a need but the interesting thing is I mean though

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I have thought now and

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
then yes I'm going through some sort of

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
linguistic midlife crisis identity crisis. I mean. So a

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
few things I

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
mean.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I have in a way been preparing for this midlife crisis since I was.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
What twenty six or seven years old. So that's interesting

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
because it's not that suddenly I was capsized

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000
by something in my what I hope is the middle of my life.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So there was this slow preparation from my

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
youth right. My young adult

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
years on the other hand I feel I feel like I'm someone who

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
has developed very slowly as a

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
person and in lots of ways.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And and I think I was I was a very very

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
young twenty something year old I wasn't like a lot of other people

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I knew who are my age I always felt very behind certain

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
respects and many respects so.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So yes on the one hand it I think I think of it as a midlife crisis. What I've

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
done with the telling

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and on the other hand I think of it as the real first adolescence of my life.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So how do you reconcile those two things because I feel both the sort

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
of person in her forty's seeking something radically new

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you know and I also feel for the first time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The child who stood up and said I'm not going to do

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
that and you know what With comes to my mind you can't reconcile.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But I like it I like it that it has these two dimensions that have this tension Yeah I

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
mean and in one sense it comes at the right time in my biological

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
arc because I

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
am forty eight. So yes it makes sense that

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
it happened. Now not ten or fifteen or twenty years ago on the other hand I do

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
feel that it has a powerful adolescent strain. What's happening

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
here you. You write in your book from the

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
creative point of view this nothing so dangerous security.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Yes

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I do.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And that seems to me the challenge that

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
YOU YOU YOU

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
YOU voiding with would have

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
been Yes well I just feel as

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
think it's not right it's not right to feel comfortable

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and it's not.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It makes me actually sort of anxious to feel

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
totally settled which is ironic because I'm a sort of profoundly unsettled

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
person in some senses

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
having not the sort of points of reference right.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
That might settle people.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Or maybe not the traditional points of reference because I do have points of reference in my life

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and I sometimes I feel very settled. If you're very rooted as a

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
person but I didn't I did as a child and if we are formed

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
by the age of seven then I definitely didn't feel

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But now

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I've completely lost my train of thought what I wanted to say.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Something I think that's necessary.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Oh no this is what I wanted to say no I think. No I mean I think exactly.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
No I mean it's like for example I noticed that the moment in which

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I wanted to leave New York when I started to feel the need

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
to go away and to leave it

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
behind was precisely at the moment when life was getting very settled.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You know life was getting very settled. We had a house we lived in and we were

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
raising our children everything was sort of going along in this direction and once I realized

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that it had kind of gone into gear and it was moving along that was the moment

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I got I had a

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
sudden deep desire to get out

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and see it from a totally different point of view or to not see it at all maybe for

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
a while just to do something

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
else that's what I wanted to say you know.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So it's that feeling of and I think especially in terms

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
of writing in terms of.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Of of the inspiration and and and the

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
work you know that the strange

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
contradiction of Italian

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which people have I mean I think I have tried to

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
explain in the book that people ask me about.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.000
When it's

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
all a series of contradictions this

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000
whole past the whole project but I think that the central one is.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You know I'm I'm looking for some kind of rootedness some kind

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
of home some kind of place point of reference all of these things that were lacking in

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
my life and so.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And why because I want to feel comfortable I want to

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
feel comforted in the world. You know I don't like this sense of. Why

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
don't I fit. And anywhere why don't I belong anywhere. Why can't I call any place home this anxiety.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And so what do I do I look for it in a totally new

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
language in which I am completely alien and I feel very much.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I am very much a stranger writer and a foreigner. I mean by definition I am

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
a foreigner in that language and yet I feel at home. It's

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
the feeling of feeling at

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
home within the. Obvious atmosphere

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
of of of the other and of foreign

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
this and. And so I think

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
there's something something to be explored there in that what

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
do other languages. Give

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
us and why are we dreaming drilled into

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
them and I was very struck.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
A few weeks ago

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I was I teach a translation workshop now it. Princeton so I

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
was preparing for the class

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and and I was reading about I was reading Cicero on translation

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and what he thought about you know he had many things to say about

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
this the say that. There's At a certain point

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
he says you know it's it's lean wild through it's the language of the

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
other that

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
can give bad that can we store to us something that is

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
missing and when I read that I realized this is what was going on that I was

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
searching for something I thought I didn't have and it was Italian that gave it to me

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and so even though it is. The other it had it was a part of me that

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
was missing.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
If I make myself clear. I hope.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So that struck me very much this idea and the whole project of translation. You know that's what's

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
behind that's what's driving translation. It's

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
this this idea of the. The other of the other

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
but everyone talks about the other but just the other language. You know and that

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
there is something that we cannot get out of the languages we

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
have at our disposal.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You know we sometimes speak about the idea that we. That I

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
cannot

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
silence.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
It so it's so hard to be self reflects a friend's a

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
person and you're saying the same thing in terms of

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
language the language in a way no chance

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
yes it is and revisit sense some way.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Well it's both it's both healing right it's had some sort of curative powers I

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
think Italian in my life. It's it's sort of curative

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yes I think it's it's it's it's healed a

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
certain. Maybe not completely but it's it's it's it's given me a

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
certain echo Librium that I needed in terms of my sort of

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
personal interior landscape and how I viewed things and

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
how I viewed myself and how I view things these are being myself

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
so I think it has had a kind of

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
curative power and yet it is the language

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
of for me. These are draw you know it's not a

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
language in which I never comfortable.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
I cannot be comfortable in the language I'm always going to be looking over my shoulder saying thinking.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Did I say that Ray did a spell that right did is that the right word that the right construction. You know

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
because it's

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
never it's never a firm under my feet. It's

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
like it's so extraordinary you were feeling discomfort.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
You went to another country and another language to

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
somehow take yourself out of this feeling of discomfort to end up in

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
a place which also made you uncomfortable.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Yes but it's like but has a terrific effect at the same

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
time. I think it's like people who devote themselves to the sea or

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
something you know it's like sailors It's like people who who can't live on the earth. They can't

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
do it. Thats too painful. It's too firm. You know.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And so they take to the sea and then they can't come

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
back begins. Exactly and so this print this metaphor of

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
the crossing and the water and swimming and I

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
think it's all kind of connected.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Yes And I think you know. I

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
remember a few years ago we were sailing around the alien

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Islands for a week in a sailboat my family

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
and with another family with whom we were close friends

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
and so we all got on to the boat and we're all very excited for this

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
adventure and I remember what. So we nobody none of us knew how

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
to sail the boat so we had a very

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
nice skipper we called him the

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
skipper

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
civilian and he said as we were setting

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
out he said well there's one thing you have to

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
know which is we don't belong here we're human

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
beings and we don't belong on the

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
water and it's dangerous and it can kill us and if it's not where

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
we're supposed to be and you have to know this and you have to respect that and you have to

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
respect the sea because it's so much powerful than we are and it really doesn't like

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
us and yet we love it and we're going to sail

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
and we're going to have a great week and we

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
did you know I mean he said it in a much found beautiful way than I am.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
But I was really struck by what he

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
said because I think it's true and I and I immediately thought of my relationship to

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Italian and I thought that that's Italian. For me I'm

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
sailing through this language and it's dangerous and I don't belong in it.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And yet it's

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
it's this sort of sublime experience for me you know you need to respect this.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And as well I need to respect it. You know I need to

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
respect what it is and what it is in relationship to me

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and the distance between us that remains forever and I have to

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
respect that even if I mean look we one can learn how

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
to swim.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
You know one can survive in the water up to a certain point and but then after a certain point

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
one will drop right. I mean we are not made to live in the water we're not fish.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So that's what the skipper was saying we're not fish we're human beings and we're not meant to be

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
here this is not our our

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
element. But I thought that was

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
very you know it sort of put things clearly for

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
me you know one of those moments but these things happened to me

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
in Italian you know these things happen when to me often with Italians who say

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
things like this and suddenly

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
everything is very clear. One thing

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
that

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
struck me is. You talk

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
about about

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
the slowness the necessity of slowness

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
and it reminded me of a wonderful line in preventing any that but and then

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
you mean mentions me says Martin. No longer works at

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
what cannot

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
be abbreviated.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Well certainly learning a language cannot be abbreviated and it's just a

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
constant prolongation rather right and it never ends.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
You can never end you can never stop learning another language

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
because it's like exploring the Pacific Ocean. I

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
mean part of the journey towards Italy was

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
a way of going

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
from a sense of failure here in this

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
country towards anonymity.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Well

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
in the real sense of the word of not quite having a.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I was I don't really think about those things very much I don't.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I don't really think of myself as being famous really in my

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.000
day to day like it doesn't really you know I'm not really aware of it but I but I like the.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I like the feeling of returning to a sort

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
of solitary state of feeling like an

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
apprentice I like that I liked

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
feeling that I like the

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
idea of writing something and

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
feeling kind of embarrassed about it I like that

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
feeling and I because I felt that when I first started writing I felt mortified.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I was so shamed I was so embarrassed I was so afraid that I was writing.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Because it wasn't something that

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
was well for a variety of reasons or shall we say it just wasn't something

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I thought comes comfortable confident doing and I was always sort

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
of pushing it away hoping it would not bother me anymore.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I think we'll

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
have a variety of reasons. When I

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
imagine that that phrase of you might

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
indicate the two passages which I read very quickly from In other

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
words which talk about you.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I mean for me they talk very much about you your tactile

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
you kind of tension feeling. They tell you

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
in language you say from the start my relationship with.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Italy is as Harry. Or the Terry. As it is

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
visually. I feel a connection and at the same time a detachment

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
a closeness and the same time distance but I feel it's

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
something physical inexplicably

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
it's

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
discreet a piece.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
An exquisite tension

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
love at first sight.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
That seems it reminded

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
me of a line I think that

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
it's mentioned here that in Latin America when makes

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
love through the

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
year but this something

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
about the or the Terry

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
quality of Italian that in a bridge

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
you must've been because it was

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
that sensation of being surrounded by it you

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
know Florence went where I first found

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
myself. And it was like

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
that how I describe it

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
that that that that

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
is you know before this

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
began and everybody was sort of talking in the end and that's how

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
it felt it was that sort

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
of murmuring collective something that I

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
knew people were saying things but I couldn't distinguish what anybody with the family came on stage

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
just you know something

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
that yes but that's how I describe it in the book you know is what I found when

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
I was in Florence I was like I

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
was it was like I had walked in and you know all of these people were just sort of talking

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
and and I was I just wanted to understand what they were saying.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
It was that it was just a desire to

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
understand. That led me on this and the

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
law. Was a kind of recognition.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Well there was a rocket recognition and that's

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
why

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Strangely it's hard for me to think it's hard for me to

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
call Italian a foreign language. I mean I know it is. But I

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.000
can't

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
bear to call it Pat says I don't think of it that way you

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
know it

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
feels familiar to me and it felt familiar to me from the

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
very

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
beginning. Before I understood a word of it. Just the way I think some people

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
you meet and you do feel like you've known them. You've

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
already known them even though you just sort of talking to them and I. You're in the middle of a canvas and

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
if you're already. You've already gone somewhere together. Who knows how

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
or where I don't

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
know reminds me of a poem.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Since I have more memories and if I was a

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
fan I somehow feel that there is something that

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
preceded the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
initial approach. Of the port.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Yes And so you're already in the middle of it you know.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And this happens sometimes when you're lucky. You know I when I met my husband I

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
thought that one with certain friends. I feel that it's like

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
well but we're already friends. We're already friends. We're just it's just a

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
matter of actually knowing what your name is but we already know each other you

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
know but you have this certain people right now with everybody but

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
with some people you do.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Thankfully not and very very yes they very thankfully I would

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
be deliberating but also very exhausted.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
I just already

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
exhausted exhausting all.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Because it's so immersive.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
what struck me also is that when you left you left your

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
library behind you left everything

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
you

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
could.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
So I do know your library and since the best I could just just died and

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
he was on the stage many many times is a line of his which I love where he says the

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
contents of someone's bookcase a part of his history like and

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Sestriere portrait. So you but you

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
you abandon your English library you say seventy nine of my

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
books useful anymore.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
They seem like ordinary objects of my creative

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
life disappears the stars that. Guided me

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
recede and this kind of India violent gesture

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
of getting rid of it. I wonder what.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.000
What's in

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
that I mean except for that dictionary that

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
you carry around before coming down here we went to the special collections

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
and saw some extraordinary objects I

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
think books of Shelley and Byron but the one that really

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
caught your attention was a dictionary called an

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
interpreter credible.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Speak about

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
recognition. Exactly you know why did I call

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
my first book that.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Anyway

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
but but your question is yes

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
this is why this.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
This. Breaking. The points

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
of reference. Well. It's I think I

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
mean and I don't mean in terms of just how heavy things are to carry I think.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.000
There's more to

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
life you know there's there's much more I mean I think on some level clearly I am trying

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
to experience

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
something that is very much a part of my family history which is

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
leaving right. Leaving those points of reference what that means.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.000
What

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.000
the

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
what the danger of that is what the

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
benefits of that may be what the mystery of that is that all of the insecurity that

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
is churned up as a result of of leaving that port

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
of you know.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
In which one is secure or one feels secure and rooted and where things make

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
sense so you know having

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
parents who who did that.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Or

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
were or. Who chose. I mean one

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
chose to do that and the

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
other followed and had other feelings about about

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
this voyage about the

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
departure but in some sense I

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
think I mean we're always trying to figure out our parents right.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
And and I haven't really stopped and

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
so I think there's

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
that there's that behind it. But I

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
think apart from the kind

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
of you know familial model and my curiosity my kind

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
of lifelong curiosity

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
about you know that fundamental.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Act of my parents you know to to go away

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
that definitive moment that voyage. That decision.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
think as an artist I did it also for

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
myself you know it wasn't just to say just to think what is

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
it like to leave your. You

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
know your known. Set of variables for

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
an onset unknown set of variables. I think it.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
There was something more on the creative

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
level play and play with his you know I

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
think story in the sense that you become.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Somehow self-sufficient.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
No I know nothing's no. Stoicism I did it all out of

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
love and devotion willing

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
you know it. I mean when you love something you just do anything for it right you live

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
for it and

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
so yes one day I stopped reading in English because I felt it

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
was it was interfering and I wanted to just concentrate on

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Italian and because that is something

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
I mean important for people to understand this if you

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
actually have this right in English.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Stop. I mean just cut your ties for a while

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
you with this language. If you don't call your

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
mother which you know to me of course resonates tremendously

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
because I grew up more or less as a linguistic monster myself

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
with many languages and I want to say that I had no mother tongue

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
but several father times you know. Somehow I didn't quite

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
have

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000
it all talk about that. But.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.000
But no I

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
think again I've lost my that's about to say I think when you say such

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
interesting things and I

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
get that you know that. I think it's because I have I have

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
no losing your train of thought and if you think that

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I'm keeping my wrong.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
I mean I don't

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
know that's partly what happens when. If it's

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
true it will come to me or maybe not

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
I like what you said to me you know. Maybe I never told you

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
but when we came back

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
from Rome in the

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
fall I called

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
you right.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
It was a very intense conversation you and I had for various reasons but

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I I said to you.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Well

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I don't really want to come back Paul but I'm going to try. I'm going to try to get used to things

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.000
again

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
here and you said but maybe you won't.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
And I thought that was such a nice thing for you to say you know it just it just took all

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
the pressure off and I thought yeah maybe I won't. And that's OK

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
too. You know because I've always been.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
I've always found it felt the obligation to always kind of conform to everything I have to do

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
this now I'll do it this way I have to do this I teach you this way and when you just when you

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
said well maybe you won't. And I thought yes maybe I won't.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Maybe I won't. Maybe it will be resolved and imperfect

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
and there will be that irritant.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
This whole notion of you know I have a great affection for

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:50.000
this whole notion of.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Well that's the thing I mean because I you know I talk about this book the

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
balance the triangle and all of these things and I

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
think yes we seek balance and everybody. Wants to

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
be peaceful and harmonious and balanced and all of these

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
things are good but well.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
mean yes or no but I mean I think if you're creating

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.000
you

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
know if you're living. If you're choosing to live outside

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
the balance zone. You

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
know and if you're actually more interested in disrupting the balance and turning it

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
upside down and poking into it and taking it apart and pulling the

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
threads out I mean this is what we're doing as as artists right through this is life is yes it would

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
be nice if it were all nice

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
and harmonious and ordered. But this order is the greater

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
power right. And so if you're in and

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
that you have to be in touch with that

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
you know you have to let it happen. You.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Yes because it's all I mean it's all well and good for me to say.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Oh you know in the middle of my life

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I I learned Italian and I you know I was

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
like tightening. My gaiety.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
But it's one thing to just to conceive of it that way and say

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I guess there was the. Bengali there was the English there was the continuous

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
war there was the crisis the anxiety and then along comes the Taliban and

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
then everything is just kind of harmonious situation but it's

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
not it's not at all it's it's so much more complicated now but it's

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
good it's a good. It's a it's a good complications a good state

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
of you know it just how do you resolve

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
something you don't you complicate it.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
You know and that's what I try to teach my students you know I don't I don't don't make don't tie it up at

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
the end. You know take it somewhere. Enrich it

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
complicated deep in it leave it ambiguous. This is life not

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
the other way around.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
I mean I feel there's so much in the chair I said you know people sometimes ask me

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
to moderate and I say but I'm not

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
moderate I would know how to do that I can instigate I cannot

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
facilitate you know when people tell me. Could you facilitate this conversation I feel like you

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
know they need to take some pills for digestion. I mean it just it just makes no sense

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
to me to facilitate the conversation but rather to show different sides

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.000
of

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
it but you know what what struck me also in the way you were

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
describing and then Bengali and then this. This is a kind of work that a

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
biographer Slater a simple biographer might try

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
to show would be with this period that period and then it was resolved by

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
this but I were lives are lived in very different ways and described in the

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
biography that tries to make sense of my life right away.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
I remember the thread that I

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
have and I don't remember I remind

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
you you said something about but

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
you're talking about the sort of renunciation moment that I

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
was a writer in in the English language and you know and then so

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
to stop reading in English and to do these things signified you

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
know and it's true.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I I was a writer in the English language.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
I was but I don't I didn't think of it that way

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
because because of this gap. I

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
felt all my life between me in English which going

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
into Italian I suddenly when I looked back I saw that it was

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
there because I don't think that it would have been possible for me to do what I've

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
done.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
If that bond were

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
more solid. You know there was always this

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
room

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
for slippage between me and all of the languages

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
right and and what I

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
think that was sort of the revelation the space between us that there is

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
no I'm not against you know and this. We now

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
can

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
perhaps discuss the hotly debated mother tongue topic if you wish

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
or not wish but but in any case this. This is the this is the

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
realisation is that even

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
though I left the house and Brooklyn full

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
of so many books in English that has shaped me informed me and inspired me

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
for so many years. I felt that there was a there.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Why didn't I miss them.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
You can look at asking me but don't you miss reading in English what's what don't you miss it.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
That's wrong but I'm with you you know there's only one with you it's like don't you miss your kid

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
you know and I didn't I didn't miss

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
English the kids maybe not. So that's the

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
thing but it was like almost something

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
unnatural like what do you mean you don't miss that if that's a part of you

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
you have to miss it you

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
know. But I didn't miss it I really

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
didn't feel freedom

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
from I did I felt freed and I felt turned on by something else

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
completely that was

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
opening up my mind and my soul and

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
everything was things were happening that

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
were surprising that I thought well I got

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
this one life and yes I have spent many years

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
reading adoring worshipping.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Writers in English so why not if I have the ability now

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
to deepen my understanding of Italian through reading which is

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
the primary you know.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
I mean the writing is a kind of a minor project compared to

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
the reading which is really

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
the what I'm doing here and reading in Italian

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
you know

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
and

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
can I share nice news with you today. I don't think it's a secret

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
but so today I was asked to be. One

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.000
of the

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
voters for the sake of

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
prize and I was so moved on and started crying.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
I thought I can't believe this you know I've been

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
trusted to vote. For.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
You know the Strayer prize which is the most

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
important prize in

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
in Italy for literature and to read for fiction.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And they're trusting me they're giving me this vote and I

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
thought

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I earned that you know with all of the study with all of this reading with all of

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
this this dip dedication of you know and maybe

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
the I mean if I hadn't if I hadn't stopped writing and reading in English

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
sorry if I hadn't made this sort of radical if I hadn't taken that

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
radical

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
step.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Perhaps that would have happened. You know because I think it's it over

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
time that I read and I read and I keep reading and

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
then you know I am able to read.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
People's novels and talk about them and then I you know I enroll more wherever

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I present them and and then you know it sort of suddenly becomes

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
apparent Oh she can she can

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
read that and she can understand and she can talk about it and all these things and

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
I I was just

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000
over were so overwhelmed this morning by this this this email I really. Anyway.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
But it was it

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.000
was not anyway you know I mean it was I was

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
very moved I really I was

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I I'm so honored. It's such a big honor for me

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
to to to do this.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:19.000
And

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
so that's when you could really imagine.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
No none of

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
it would switch.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
But I did like a

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
time

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
because there

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
was no ambition. I mean there was ambition and that I wanted

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
to but you know. Just to and with

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
that also you know when people

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
say

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
that from assume I think this is so

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
missing the point because missing often. It's not a

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
part of you.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Well exactly I mean look if someone

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
said you know you've been away for five months.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Don't you miss your family and I said Well not really well then that person would

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
have a reasonable right to say well maybe there's something going on with that

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
family

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
right because the ordinary person would say well yes of course I miss them

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
because you're connected to them that's the thing you're connected to them and your life

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000
is is a whole with them together and a web

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
of affection of love of rituals of day to day

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
everything you know it's like they form your identity right.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
So that's what I'm talking about

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
so but but but but being away from

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
English going away leaving the books behind and not missing them.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Shed light on the fact that the relationship. It was

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
perhaps more complicated than I

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000
realized and he's also you know it alls for permitting a certain freedom that

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
you speak about in the book and we've spoken about this once before.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
It reminds me of that great moment in maces Eric Our

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
where he talks about arriving in is somebody without any book since

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
the war and

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
he sort of ruminating and thinking that it

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
is precisely because he doesn't have a library that he's able to write probably

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
one of the greatest books of literary criticism ever written.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
If he was freed

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
of of the impediment.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Now is a book it's a very basic travel metaphor. Yeah. Write it

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
with which I mean of the various metaphors at play in the

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.000
book in my

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
book that is kind of the key. Yeah right it's it's

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
the going away. It's it's the the sailing. However you want to call it but

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
it's it's it's Odysseus it's the desire to tell one

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
story as the unknown as the

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
other masked getting in the other land. You know I'm going to talk about

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
myself and I'm going to tell you about my adventures but I'm going to pretend not to be who I

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
am an awful thing of course he returned and that that is you know.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
But it is that impulse. It's the voyage. It's it's like the you

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
know it's the beginning of literature right. It's it's that's

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
how literature is

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
born the voyage the going away the unknown the

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
encounter with the other and the becoming the

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
other and so I feel like in my own small way

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
I'm responding to that you know I'm responding in this book

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
to decades. Reading I'm responding to be a being a student at Barnard

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
College in the eighty's and having my head spinning

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
with ideas and feeling overwhelmed in the best

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
of ways

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
by too much I mean by the too much of it all.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Exactly and I think in this book I. In Italian

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
I'm able to start really looking and thinking about all

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
of what has gone in

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
uncirculated sedimented and all of that you

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
know with a certain strange

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
clarity in spite of all of the kind

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
of difficulties the awkwardness. The brusqueness the lack

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
of grace in spite of those things.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
There's just that sheer that sheer will to see things clearly

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
for want

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
of you to feel about you your rediscovery of

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
reading again this notion of slowness of reading in Italian as a way of going

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
back to the initial immersive quality of reading as a

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
child. You say I read as I did when I

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
was as a writer I

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
rediscover the pleasure of reading. Reminding me

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000
of a wonderful line of color who speaks about

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
the slowness in this movement of slow food in it.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
And also in the world in the movement also which he thinks should exist

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
of slow reading. You

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
know there is a pace at

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
which if one reads writes one. And if one

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
reads too quickly maybe one doesn't

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
understand when we read too fast or too slow. We understand

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
nothing like Pascal says constantly Toby to talk to

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
small. You're

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
a new thing. So I'm wondering if the experience of learning and reading

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
in Italian has taught you to read in a different way.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
So young in what way. Well.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
I mean I have to read. More actively Right. Because

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
it's I'm going. I mean now it's different now I been

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
reading for four years I just read in Italian so I found

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
a certain.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
More or less I just go you know it's not like four years

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000
ago when I was just filling up notebook after notebook with all of these

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
words I didn't know and you know it was a kind of. It was a very different

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
kind of experience you know because I my vocabulary was was very

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.000
scant

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000
and and I was reading literature so you know I mean I was reading writers

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
and I just I could access it. I mean I

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
knew more or less what was being said but I wasn't I wasn't getting it I wasn't getting the

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
the depth of it the the all of the the the so

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
much what I was just

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
I couldn't get the subtleties right the shadings of the language and then

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
there were simply millions of things like I simply didn't understand at all like what does that word mean I don't

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
know I had to look it

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
up because all of this is happening alone. You know but

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
nobody's helping me nobody's reading with me I'm not reading for a class I'm not reading with a

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
teacher I mean I work hard on my conversation with

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.000
with

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
people so people would

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
say See Chikezie this is you know and they would they would

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:42.000
force that

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000
muscle into some. Coherent shape.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
But the reading was a very solitary you know deliberate deliberate

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
path of my own and I had different strategies that

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000
I kind of talk about in the book and you know. I

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:07.000
realized I mean I remember even in Rome in the beginning I would read.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000
In this in this you know I had a whole set up you know I would have had the book and then I

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000
had the the dictionaries and then the little notebook and you know

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
I just I had all of the I needed it I needed. All I needed the support kind

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:22.000
of

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
and and now I I need it less you know I mean I underline the

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
word here or there. Sometimes I don't Sometimes I know all the words you

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
know

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
and the dictionary doesn't go with you everywhere anymore.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Well the original dictionary that I talk about in Florida.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
It's a character. Yes they're really the main character.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
I think that he's here John why you love. I did and it was cold because I was different

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
I did as a bar of

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
soap and that one was also I mean you know it had that

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000
green bar of soap like kind of the

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
quality but the original dictionary that I

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
bought in Boston before

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
going to

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Florence for the first time. That I

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
keep Now in my drawer and in my my desk and it just

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:20.000
is

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
there because. It doesn't help me anymore because it's an it's

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000
not a monolingual dictionary and so. I mean I won't say I know all the

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
words in it I

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
don't but but your word but of gradual but the words I do I have in the words

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
I tend to look up. Aren't there

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
anymore so I just keep it in a

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
drawer and now I carry around with me I have

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000
various pocket Italian dictionaries that are just in Italian.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000
I mean I noted there was a moment in my along this road.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
You know you have certain signposts when you look back and you say oh this was this. Was when I started.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:01.000
You

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
know but there was a moment

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
in in Rome actually. You know because

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
I have these little notebooks I have my own kind of I'm private lexicon

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000
at this point of these little notebooks where I just write all the words that I don't

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
know and so many of the first notebooks were all filled

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
with

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
the definitions in English right so. Because he had

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
a glass whatever I mean I just kept writing the the definitions in English and that a

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
certain point I just I realize all the definitions were being written in Italian just out of

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
it like something happened in my

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
head and I didn't know that I wasn't even aware of it exactly.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
So now for years when I look up words and I write them I don't I don't

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
write the definition and. In English I write it in a

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
talent.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000
And that was when I switched over to all of the monolingual dictionaries. So I just.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
You know I have a I bought it the labyrinth bookstore and Princeton.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
You know I was desperate I thought I can't have an office that an Italian dictionary in it

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
right that's not right and I went and I got the

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
the most kind of bearable. Look like the big the best one I I

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.000
brought it back to the

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000
office and every time I tried to look up a word it's out there.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
I mean the words I need aren't in the dictionary anymore and I but I hate the online dictionary I mean I go to

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000
it of course I have to sometimes. The library and print from I love the library my

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000
God it's so nice when it's like the nicest thing in Princeton.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Firestone the Firestone

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000
is really knowing that open. You know interest for in the morning.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Well I don't live there so I don't know but maybe when I live there. If I can't sleep it finds some point I

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
think I'm going to go tell your dictionary. Well it's just a beautiful library. You know.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Really is and

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
I scoped out the whole

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Italian section. They know who they are

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
so we never we

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
never stop

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
trying to. To understand I will

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
parents at one

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
point very much towards the end of your book you say I came to it.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Partly to know my character

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.000
inspector comma my parrot.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Extraordinary

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
sentence my characters

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000
better not have a few. But after that with comes.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Well I mean so many of my characters were inspired by my parents writer

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
not specifically by my parents but but my parents' lives

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000
their experiences. Their load of being

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
their concerns

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
their you know their

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
reality the reality they carry within them that

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
I was that I was exposed to and sensitive to and privy to which I

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.000
knew was at at odds with the reality at large

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
in my life growing up here. And so when

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
you. When you're raised by people who are living in a different reality.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
You

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
know a state of constant.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Yes constant nostalgia constant What does this word mean I mean constant

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000
you know trying to figure it out constant you

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
know anxiety. You know in

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
some sense.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Not without their bearings. You know not without

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
some entity. And of course with

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
time yes then this

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
process even fast a little bit and one learns

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
and learned to cope and survive and build and enjoy and

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
move forward in another world. But you know but but

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I am the first child and I

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
are beginning

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
are you know my parents just.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Just figuring it all out.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And that. That's those are my first seven years. You know that

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
marked me so profoundly.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I can't really if I have any point of reference it's

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
that it's all of that anxiety

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and confusion and distress

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
everything by the way happening in another language not in

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
English we had no people who spoke English ever came into our

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
home.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So that's how it

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
was and. Has

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
been transformed into for.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Kind of place. And the federal

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
for not the homeland but it's it's it's

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I mean the whole world

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000
of the whole idea of mythology so interesting you know this kind of a.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Yes

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
it's a home that you have made for us it's

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
not like the home of

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
your parents was a specific place that was this is a

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
place that has become yours out of kind of a deliberate.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Yes it's a nostalgia that I've created. It's a sickness that

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I've that I went out and expose myself to on purpose. You know.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
But I think it.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
We spoke about that a little bit you know the whole idea of the Felder was created in

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
the seventeenth century. With

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
physicians who discovered that the Swiss

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Army mercenaries were missing there. And so

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
he created the girls kind of for the

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
homeland to incredible.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I mean that is an invented word is incredible you know just from the linguistic point of view that

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
that very powerful because I think language.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Is one of the principal tools for.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
I hate this verb battling but I guess one of the principles two tools

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
for for for coping with

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
nostalgia for feeling it. You

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
know I mean all of poetry. So much of poetry

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
is coming out of that in it and

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
that what is the what is the way to express this

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
it's language right and it's so it strikes me that it's the word itself isn't as kind

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
of deliberate construction around these two Greek you

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
know what

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
would we do without. With you I mean we need.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Well

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I think I mean I maybe I think so I mean I was I

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
was strangely jealous of my mother's nostalgia though. As I watched

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
her being consumed by

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
it as I watched her suffering from it so deeply.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You know and all I wanted to do as a child was take on a style just way. I just wanted

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
to smother it with a blanket. Because I knew how painful it

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
was for her. To feel

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
it and I just I everything I was just I was and I was of

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
course powerless to do anything because it was so

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
huge and the place was so far and the relationship was so

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
this broken and distant and never enough never enough.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Nothing and nothing ever satisfied. You know no trip. If it was one

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
month couldn't it be two months it was two months why couldn't it be four months it was six months

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
why couldn't it be a year. You

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
know. So when you're

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.000
watching you know when I was watching my mother going through this

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and I thought she's still going through it. He hasn't stopped.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Really it's changed but it hasn't stopped

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and and I just I wanted so desperately to to make it go

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
away and the fact that I couldn't do it made me

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
so.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I just I just hope somehow I could do something about it I mean I

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
remember once I gave her little I gave her

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
a wallet. And as a gift and I went to Calcutta

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
and I took a photograph of the building where she was

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
raised you know her her. IFTIKHAR her

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
everything you know her frame of reference the place where she was

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
happy right. I took a little picture of it and I put it in the

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
little transparent window and I gave this to her as a gift and I thought well

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
maybe every time she opens up the wallet. She'll see the the photograph of

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
the building.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But these are other things for a child to write. Maybe not

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
so I don't I mean I love my mother I wanted her to feel

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
better you know.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
But but then what happens. Years later.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I mean I can I make this journey on my own

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and on purpose everything on purpose everything sort out everything

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
to

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
deliberate and then I come back and. I find

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
myself suffering in my own way.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Very

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
last very looking at pictures of my apartment and staring at the

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
computer screen thing. Oh yes there is my desk you

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
know. But I was strangely proud of

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
that feeling because I felt that it meant that I was

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
somewhere in my

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
heart but that the physical place. I mean

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
already rooted in many ways you know I did my family I did with

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
my my children my husband I'm rooted with my work with my

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
books in any language and those things.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And I have been for some time you know I think

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
ever since the moment I became a writer I felt somehow.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
OK I'm connected somehow to the world to the universe.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
It's going to be OK.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I love in your book where you say Today I no longer feel.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
To risk a lost country to my parents. It took me a

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
long time to

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000
accept that my writing did not have to assume that responsibility in

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
that sense in other words it's the first book I've written.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
But also from the linguistic point of view as a

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
child I continue as a writer to seek the truth. But I don't give the

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
same weight to affect trends in Italian and moving

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
towards

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
abstraction. The place is defined the characters

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and nameless without the particular cultural. And. The result

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I think is writing that is fried in certain ways from the concrete.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
One can screw

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
up and less be sued for

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
expecting. A simple question with you what you mean

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
by

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
obstruction. Well I mean

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
exactly

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
what it what it is is as you know abstract in that it could be any

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
place that that the need for this specific place falls away because again I

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
mean to go back to the little wallet

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000
anecdote. What is that about it's the fact that a specific play is

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
one place in the world one

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
building in one city.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
You know in the world is

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
is the center of you know what I perceive to be the center of my mother's happiness and well

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
being and so the distance from that city the the going

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000
back to that house staying in that house everything is sort of determined by that one

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
specific

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
building right. And

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
so in a way I mean. So yes on the one hand

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'm sort of jealous of my my mother's nostalgia and jealous of that sense

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
of I OK there's a place in the world that that that is so

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
important and that I'm so identified with that this is kind of the thing that defines me even if I can't

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
have it.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000
It defines me you know I define myself in opposition or in in absentia

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I'm still defined by it right and on the other hand

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
feel you know I just I just want to

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
obliterate the power that it has the power that place

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
has you know I just wanted. It's like all of this all of this

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
identity the whole business

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
that identity is is something that I

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
think I'm really thinking about very different. The right now

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and trying to get beyond it and trying to sort of you know get to the

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
other side of all of these labels

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
and everything you know your language writer in the English language over

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
your Indian American obit Calcutta

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Oh but this is no you know and I feel like I feel all of the books I've written

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
until this. They're all about that it's all in a sense.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Trying to put into books the picture in that wallet

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
to say that's a common my parents.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Yes that's it it's like how can I render present.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
How can I bring to them what is

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
missing and should the child. As you were saying earlier feel that.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I mean which

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
yes yes and so if I write stories now that have nothing to

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
do with that

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
specific neighborhood that street that building those times. I'm

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
free free I'm free because I feel like now I can express I can write really what are what

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I want and what I need to write without fine and yes and this is

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
very liberating for

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
me this is very liberating for me because I think the whole all of the past four

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
books the frame of reference of

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
my parents in fact I know it you know.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
In an earlier conversation we had I'm on now on a series I have called a phone call

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
from pawn you you mentioned to me.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Your discovery in Italian of a Romanian writer who wrote in

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
French with magnificent great or

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
not very well known in America but the little bit Susan Sontag made

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
him somewhat well known at a point when people read Susan

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Sontag called I know my students read how do you make one so your students

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
know you're home the great Rumanian writer who wrote a book

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
called in English it's called The trouble with being born but. Correct translation

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
it's of the inconvenience. Of the inconvenience

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
of being born and I thought I would read you one passage and just

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
have you react to it and the passage goes like

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
this everyone has had at a given

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
moment an extraordinary experience which will be for him.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Because of the memory of

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
it he preserves the crucial.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Obstacle to his metamorphosis.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Well I mean every word he writes in this book is is

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
very powerful you know I yes I read I mean it was

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
a we have certain books that we read and

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
they one never forgets experience of reading

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
them so reading this book in Italian for me was was one of those

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
it wasn't even maybe it was a year ago so fairly

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
recent A friend told me about the book I'd never heard of

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
him but a friend of mine who is actually the translator the

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Italian translator. Have got others.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Her name is.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I think is her last name anyway.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
She

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
she told me about him one day we were having dinner she said you know you know

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
children children children and I

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
said I said yes' and I mean she said well you must you must read

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
him you know because he writes about he writes

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
all about his passage from Romanian to French

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
and I think you're really going to you know you're going to

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
say that I think you need to read him.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And. You know it's was one of those life changing encounters with the with

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
the mind with and and

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
and this book in particular I mean he writes. So.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Powerfully succinctly about so many of the themes. I think that that have

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
been preoccupying me as a person I mean I'm not talking about this was

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of well it's interesting that's the heart of the book right and also

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
the what you read is is you

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
know is is certainly resonates on many many levels in terms

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
of but it's interesting what you say but the obstacle to metamorphosis. You know and maybe

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
the obstacle to metamorphosis. Yes he says it. The obstacle

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
to metamorphosis is that sense of.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I mean you know

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I saw one of these one of the other extraordinary things about my learning

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Italian is that I was able to then

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
have.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
You know psychotherapy in Italian Right after years

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000
of in English so this is a whole other fascinating journey I was

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
making right in another language and I I'm curious now I'm very curious I've talked to some

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
people about you know what it means

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
to have that experience in IT IN learned language.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
But you know one of the. One of the things that you

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
know. She told

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
me very early on was you know every

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
change necessitates a betrayal.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
So you know on you can get mentally ready men though.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
well when you read that to me I think OK Yes I went through this

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I sort of.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
she she I mean I don't want to talk about my psychotherapist that was bad but there but you know

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
she there words that she said she that she uses that are

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000
helpful to me is you know she says things like you know stay out of Korea though.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
You know you are creating

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
yourself in what you're doing this is part of what you're

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
doing and she's right of course and this

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
this will

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
metamorphosis. You know not a natural metamorphosis I'm not a caterpillar but of I mean

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
this is

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
not genetically programmed into me right.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
so in some sense I'm doing something very unnatural. And the

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
other day at the Italian embassy and in Washington. I talked

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
about and other sort of metaphor that came to

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
me after writing out about all the. The term

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
an Italian is is in NESTORE. Which means

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
graft right. The botanical term. To graft

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and and I think this is another one of those key

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
metaphors for what's happening here for me on the little linguistic level. I am trying

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
to graft myself onto Italian Why because I'm trying

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
to grow in some other in

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
another way another direction with some you know and what is the point of

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
the graft. What is the point of the nest with to to obtain a

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
new food a perhaps a better food right. So I think is a very interesting metaphor

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:45.000
and in fact I discovered by reading I was reading and then I found.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And in life you know Scooter.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Which is translated as the carrier the last child maybe

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
a lost

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
daughter.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
She there's a moment in which the mother

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
character this sort of troubled one of the many probabl mother characters in the novels about

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
an affair and the and she's talking about her relationship to her two

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
daughters and she says you know she's

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
she's commenting on how they're different from

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000
from from from herself and how they're traits that are more like her husband with

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
whom she has a of course naturally a strange

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
relationship always things and she's only one point they never

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
could for Sunni nesters well yet though. I fear that it was a that

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
was that that was a failed the nest Oh this this bond with her

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
children the failed graft.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And I was really. Very struck by that

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
terminology the failed graft and I I thought about it I thought about it and I wrote

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
a piece about it actually in Italian could kind of try

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
to pick it apart and unpack it a little bit

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
and and I do think that what I'm doing with the language

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
is there is there's that element

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
of you know the fear the fear that it's going to be a failed graft

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and so many people have criticized me for what I'm doing you know from the very beginning from even before I wrote

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
the book you know. You know don't do this don't do

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
this be good it's bad it's bad career it's bad for you it's

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000
bad for them it's bad for everybody just don't do it just walk away but just walk away.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Just go away you know from just walk away from the room you

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
know because they

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
know well they still may be right

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
but but the point

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
is it's it was so when you make the nest.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I mean it's sort of you know in good faith and you hope

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
you put it together. Dr WOOD. Yes. You put it together you join these

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
you fuse these elements and then you kind of

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
hope that something will solidify and that

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
over time something will come of that kind of operate

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
does an operation right on

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
purpose to to

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
join to to regenerate in some way.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Right so this whole outdoor Gratz yarn if you know what is that all about is sort of this

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.000
we generative impulse a remaking impulse.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
But I mean I

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
think so many artists on so

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
many paths

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
are. What is the word so many points along the journey.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Do things like this you know and

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
hope and hope and and throw away and don't look the other way

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
and stop doing what they're doing and what I meant

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
by Little did they know that you would

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
stop you

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
know you will very deliberately

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
prove persevering

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
regardless but that's the adolescent part of this midlife crisis but maybe midlife crises

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
are basically a second adolescence maybe this is nothing new but it's true but it's

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
better that's what it is you know I mean. And it was it was interesting because you know I

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000
was thinking a lot of us Philip Guston before I went to Rome. Because he went to Rome.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Of course and it was in Rome that he had his we thinking.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Back

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
to the figurative you know or to the figurative.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
and I too was looking for something. And I I mean how does Philip got you know

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I have a Philip Guston beautiful postcard of a book one of his

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
books of right over my desk in Brooklyn. I look at it all the time

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000
right and.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Little did I know that

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
this all of this would start to happen.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The Metamorphosis the graft. But

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
again you have there is a betrayal implicit.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You know and maybe part of the betrayal is being able to say to

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000
myself I can write what I want to write how I want to

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
write in whatever language I choose to write and I don't have to listen to

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
everybody telling me how to write it. What to write about and what language to

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.000
use

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
the noise around. Yes I promised everybody in

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
thing free for you've named for them to hear

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
your seven words. OK Here you have seven

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
words. In Italian and maybe

01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:01.000
maybe then you can translate them as you did for me in English.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000
OK found something.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Which I translated as without a mother tongue by

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
words.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Five words.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Could have been used or and

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
so beautifully by me Loesch where he says language.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I was reminded of it when reading you know the

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
word I'd like to close by reading a

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:48.000
passage.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Why do I write. To investigate the mystery of

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
existence to tolerate myself to get closer. To everything that is outside

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
of

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000
me if I want to understand what moves me what confuses me what

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000
pains me everything that makes me react in short I have to put it into

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
words writing is my only way of absorbing and organizing life.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Otherwise it would terrify me it would upset me too

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
much with passes without being put into words without being

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000
transformed and in a certain sense purified by the crucible of writing has no

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
meaning for me only words that seem real and they have

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.000
a

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000
power of various a period to us. Given that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I try to decipher everything through writing maybe writing in Italian is simply my

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
way of learning the language in a more profound more stimulating

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
way ever since I was a child I belonged. Only to my

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
words I don't have a country specific culture. If I didn't

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
write if I didn't work with words I wouldn't feel that I'm

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
present on those what does the word mean and the life in the end it seems

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
to me the same

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
thing just as a word can have many dimensions many

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:18.000
nuances great complexity so too can a person a life.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Language is a mirror and the principle of

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
metaphor because ultimately the meaning of a word like that of

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
a person is. Boundless

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
ineffable Now I've asked John Boehner he read to read that

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
passage in the original in Italian.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Thank you.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Take

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
is cleaver. That in the garden he stated it is there just

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
answer the tell that Artemis Tesa that have if he had to touch

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
OK he's over the forty the

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000
men tell you could be a queer looking you call peace quite like me

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
confound could have been younger. Breaded to to Chuck in me for

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
a little metal Imperioli. The three to a

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
new only co model there a sort of B. to it but system and I viewed

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000
her as three men team is going to school mentor in the U.S. convoy

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
her bitter Opal.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Chalk it past the censors had a message missing but all the censor said it as a transformer

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
to an inch at a percent so what if you got all the coach wall O. the last

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
previewed it and he can laugh at men.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So if at all they could run on the sand and rarely.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
A lot of superiority

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
annoyed the surveyor provided she fretted to try me to last three

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
to were forced to scream any Tell Ya know some bitch I meant in your model but apprehended in a

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
lean one and not a few profound though used to malign

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
the thing that I got has been that I got other tangles than telling

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
me about only one owned by a zone a call to a place she's

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
a sentence previously said on Lover S.C.L. a

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
parolee not me centered I present us with a
